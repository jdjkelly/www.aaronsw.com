<p>Dave Winer asks: <strong>Why is RSS 1.0 called RSS?</strong></p>
<p>RSS 1.0 was an attempt to combine what we saw as the best parts of RSS: the simplicity and extensibility of RDF (used in RSS 0.9) with the power of the new tags introduced in RSS 0.91, while remaining backwards-compatible. It seemed reasonable for the successor to RSS and RSS to be named RSS, especially since it was compatible with all tools that could already read RSS.</p>
