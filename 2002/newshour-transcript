<p><strong>BBC:</strong> Now in the dim and distant past...
...you could get out of paying your phone bill with wire cutters and
small clamps. All illegal of course... ...but those who knew how
could tap into the system without the bother or wait of a costly
connection. Well now meet the new generation getting free internet
access, they're called warchalkers because that's what they do,
marking buildings where you can connect free. Aaron Swartz age
15... runs the warchalker website.</p>

<p><strong>AS:</strong> Basically.. ..you just take your
laptop walking around the streets of wherever you're looking to
warchalk or driving in a car and then when a wireless network pops up
on the screen... you just make a couple of marks on the ground so
that other people will be able to find it later.</p>

<p><strong>BBC:</strong> This is is really easy, you just
walk around with a laptop and if you want to link to the internet you
just find a big company with a computer system and you're in.</p>

<p><strong>AS:</strong> Yea, often times the networks are
from families who bought a base station so they could surf the
internet from anywhere in the house.</p>

<p><strong>BBC:</strong> Which are the best targets?</p>

<p><strong>AS:</strong> I found it works better when you go
to residential neighborhoods... Businesses put passwords on the
network or do other things to keep people out, they aren't interested
in sharing.</p>

<p><strong>BBC:</strong> Isn't what you're doing illegal?
You're supposed to pay for internet access aren't you?</p>

<p><strong>AS:</strong> If someone is willing to give you
internet access, I dont see why its illegal to use that. It's not the
fleecing of America [where there are no alternatives for internet
access].</p>

<p><strong>BBC:</strong> You say if they want to give you
their internet access.... Companies want you to visit their website,
but I'm not so sure about the families where you're camped outside
their house using a computer.</p>

<p><strong>AS:</strong> Some people say that, but when you
set up the network, all the [config] programs I've used ...ask you if
you want to set a password. The general assumption is that if they
don't want to put a password on it, they probably don't mind other
people using it.</p>

<p><strong>BBC:</strong> So you reckon that if they haven't
actually blocked you out, all the people and companies [who have
wireless networks] are sort of welcoming you in...</p>

<p><strong>AS:</strong> In most cases people have a cable
modem or a DSL line which they pay a fixed fee for. If you happen to
check your email or download a few web pages, its not really going to
cost them any more money and its not going to slow down their
internet access.</p>

<p><strong>BBC:</strong> They probably don't have a law
covering this, but are you a bit uneasy? What would happen if you got
caught?</p>

<p><strong>AS:</strong> Obviously they haven't made any
laws specifically about it, but I don't feel its immoral. I don't
condone people trying to crack passwords on networks or breaking into
networks that have other means to keep people out, but most people
I've met seem to feel its the neighborly thing to do to provide a
free internet connection; so I don't think theres anything wrong with
looking for one.</p>

<p><strong>BBC:</strong> He really doesn't sound like a
crook does he? Aaron Swartz, aged 15 who runs the warchalker
website.</p>
