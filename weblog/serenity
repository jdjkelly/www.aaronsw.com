<p>So <em>Buffy</em> ran its course, <em>Angel</em> got canceled, and <em>Firefly</em> saw its untimely demise. But all is not over for Joss Whedon &#8212; <em>Firefly</em> is back, this time in the for of the feature film <em><a href="http://www.serenitymovie.com/">Serenity</a></em>. Along with the rest of the diehard Joss Whedon fans, I&#8217;m on the edge of my seat. By all accounts the film is going to be amazing.</p>

<p>In this time of increasing polarization between left and right blogospheres, of <a href="http://alicublog.blogspot.com/">endless politically-tinged cultural crticism</a>, it&#8217;s more important to see some pop culture we can unite behind. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s nice to see that <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/025717.php">the leading blogs of the right</a> and <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_09_18.php#006614">those of the left</a> can get behind this film, with impressive marketing finesse. Here&#8217;s how the film is described:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joss Whedon, the Oscar &#8212; and Emmy &#8212; nominated writer/director responsible for the worldwide television phenomena of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, <em>Angel</em>, and <em>Firefly</em>, now applies his trademark compassion and wit to a small band of galactic outcasts 500 years in the future in his feature film directorial debut, Serenity. The film centers around Captain Malcolm Reynolds, a hardened veteran (on the losing side) of a galactic civil war, who now ekes out a living pulling off small crimes and transport-for-hire aboard his ship, Serenity. He leads a small, eclectic crew who are the closest thing he has left to family &#8212; squabbling, insubordinate and undyingly loyal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how thrilled I am to have managed to nab two tickets to a preview screening here in Boston! The place is practically alive with buzz over this thing &#8212; family, friends, random folks at parties are all talking about it.  I&#8217;ll be sure to tell you all about how great it was after I see it.</p>

<p>nice job pimping :) I too got tickets (the blogger giveaway) for Monday in Los Angeles. I shall be pimping too.</p>

<p>I think the thing about Firefly is it aimed for hard-sci fi, with actual explanations for various matters of science, and enough &#8220;future&#8221; to explain for some things i never explained (gravity matching on the colonized outer planets for instance, or terraforming).</p>
