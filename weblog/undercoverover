<h1>Is Undercover Over?</h1>

<p>My latest piece for <em>Extra!</em> is now up:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3391">Is Undercover Over?: Disguise seen as deceit by timid journalists</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s about the rise and fall of undercover journalism. Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Undercover reporting has a storied history. Nellie Bly, famous for traveling around the world in 80 days, also did a famed investigation of the conditions in insane asylums for the New York World. Bly feigned insanity for a series of physicians before being committed to a lunatic asylum. There she documented rotten and spoiled food, freezing living conditions, frigid bathwater, abusive nurses and relatively sane fellow residents. &#8220;What, excepting torture, would produce insanity quicker than this treatment?&#8221; she wondered. The series, later published as the book Ten Days in a Mad-House, created a sensation, and Bly was asked to join a government investigation of asylum conditions.</p>

<p>I liked the article and agree with the opinion that it seems to convey.</p>

<p>The question running through my head while reading it, &#8220;Is it really that hard not to get sued?&#8221; It seems like you can be creative in your deception and double check your allegations. Furthermore, are allegations made by undercover investigations any more likely to spur a lawsuit than those made through more conventional journalism?</p>
