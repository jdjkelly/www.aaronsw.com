<h1>Secured Leisure</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, I flattered myself that, by the sufficient though moderate fortune I had acquired, had secured leisure during the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spence&#8217;s apparatus, who had come from England to lecture in Philadelphia, and I proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the public, now considering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their purposes; every part of our civil government—and almost at the same time&#8212;imposing some duty upon me. The Governor put me into the commission of the peace; the corporation of the city chose me one of the common council, and soon after alderman; and the citizens at large elected me a burgess to represent them in the Assembly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Improved ecommerce for public benefit?</p>

<p>Someone with computer skills and leisure might take a look at a project that could make new business models feasible &#8212; especially for musicians, artists, and other small businesses selling digital content at low prices.</p>

<p>By lucky accident I explored possible uses for online financial accounts that could REPRODUCE through any number of generations, inherit many services, options, and methods through family trees, and evolve in community use. It&#8217;s new and appears revolutionary, but hasn&#8217;t received much attention.</p>

<p>My overview at www.smart-accounts.org may look too good to be true. But if it won&#8217;t work, then somebody who&#8217;s bright could figure that out quickly. I&#8217;ve looked for a showstopper for two years and haven&#8217;t found one.</p>

<p>This idea needs both commercial and open-source development. It should be available for all, not locked away in some corporation&#8217;s patent collection. I published it quietly for just that purpose, and have no proprietary claims.</p>

<p>Aaron, you should get business cards printed up that say &#8220;International man of leisure&#8221;.  It&#8217;ll get the point across.  Works with the ladies too, I hear.</p>
