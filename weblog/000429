<p>I&#8217;m getting lots of OSCON spam all of the sudden. I guess someone&#8217;s spamming the Who&#8217;s Who list.</p>

<p>Theodore Gray of Wolfram has <a href="http://theodoregray.com/BrainRot/">a wonderful rant on educational software</a>. It covers everything from why we shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of calculators and other software that relieves kids of rote tasks to why video games are harmful (&#8220;The Army learned that the way to get soldiers to reliably pull the trigger was to use very basic, repetitive operant conditioning, along the lines of standard behaviorist theory.&#8221;) to why most educational software is awful (it&#8217;s made by the same people who make video games) all in a delightful dialog style filled with insight and humor. The only issue is that he uses &#8220;hard&#8221; when he means &#8220;complex&#8221;.</p>

<p>Two years in the making&#8230; <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2002/debian-devel-announce-200207/msg00011.html">Woody!</a> <em>Party time!</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/mc/te/officeformats.htm">McCusker on planned fragility</a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s likely true Office uses such inflexible code that feature changes do need file format changes.  But it&#8217;s certain this is <em>planned fragility,</em> in analogy to the better known concept of <em>planned obsolescence.</em> When formats are more fragile, it&#8217;s easy to force entire communities to upgrade software when new versions ship, because network effects punish users of old versions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Russ Nelson has been trying to <a href="http://russnelson.com/dmca-hacking.html">hack the DMCA</a> too. He&#8217;s got <a href="http://russnelson.com/pads/">some One-Time-Pads</a> that might be interesting someday. My legal-oriented friends say this kind of thing doesn&#8217;t work, because if the courts think you&#8217;re playing games with them they&#8217;ll rule against you. Courts don&#8217;t work rationally like programs do.</p>

<p>Cool, Kevin &#8220;PythonCard&#8221; Altis and <a href="http://russnelson.com/">Russ Nelson</a> are also giving lightning talks. I feel bad not being able to live up to such company. I wonder what else I could present.</p>

<p>Judging from <a href="http://pgp.dtype.org:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;search=0x2C54C8FA">the people who signed his key</a> Leland Wallace looks pretty interesting.</p>

<p>Guido: &#8220;Your talk has been accepted for the Python Lightning Talks sessions&#8221;</p>

<p>ugh, I better do something today or I&#8217;ll have wasted the whole week. (that&#8217;s called vacation.)</p>
