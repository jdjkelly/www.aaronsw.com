<h1>Last Goodbyes</h1>

<p>It&#8217;s minutes to midnight and I&#8217;m hurriedly packing. Early tomorrow morning I catch a flight to Boston and start <a href="movingon">my new life</a>. I haven&#8217;t really gotten much of a chance to pack until now, because I&#8217;ve spent the past few days in a rush of meetings, getting in my last goodbyes for everyone I know in San Francisco.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been great seeing everyone, but like most locals, they&#8217;re all puzzled as to why I&#8217;m leaving. I&#8217;ve been struggling to explain why. When I say the weather, everyone just laughs. When I say San Francisco is too loud, they start arguing. When I say it&#8217;s the people, they tell me to find a better group of friends.</p>

<p>And the thing is, they&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s none of these. I&#8217;ve been spectacularly unable to articulate it, but the real answer is simpler and more prosaic. And now, after great thought and struggle, I realize the answer is simply this: <em>Cambridge is the only place that&#8217;s ever felt like home.</em> It&#8217;s that simple. And when you put it that way, it&#8217;s clear why I have to go.</p>

<p>So goodbye Stanford, goodbye Palo Alto; goodbye south bay, goodbye peninsula; goodbye Change Congress, goodbye Creative Commons; goodbye Mission, goodbye SOMA; goodbye friends, goodbye loved ones; goodbye San Francisco, home to everyone I&#8217;ve ever loved. You&#8217;ll always have my heart.</p>

<p>Bye, Aaron.  I feel the same way about New Mexico, sigh.</p>

<p>That, my friend, is an un-arguable point. Home is home. And whatever and wherever you feel it, enjoy it. We&#8217;ll miss you&#8230;but undoubtedly throw an internet tether around you now and again.</p>

<p>Cheers and safe travels!</p>

<p>While one can&#8217;t argue with your feelings, I still think moving from sunny San Francisco to miserable-weather Cambridge, is crazy. You can&#8217;t go home again, as home is a moment in time.</p>

<p>it&#8217;s understandable. for all the back and forth on the merits of this place and that, it was when you told me that it felt like home i stopped arguing. well, about what you should do, anyway.</p>

<p>Welcome back. I&#8217;m glad to hear you had such a positive experience here.  Hope you you keep that warm fuzzy feeling as you settle down, reconnect with the scene, develop a strong local network, and realize what a bunch of a-holes we are.  (BTW, my one-word response to complaints about New England weather: Iowa.)</p>
