<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/05.html#rss_feed_changes">Mark Pilgrim struggles with RSS feeds and aggregators</a>: &#8216;I don&#8217;t use my aggregator to <em>read</em> things; I use it to <em>find things to read</em>. I tried the whole &#8220;read everything in your aggregator&#8221; thing, and it depresses me. It reminds me of when I used to smoke, and everything tasted the same.&#8217;</p>

<p>Odd, I completely disagree. Background: I&#8217;ve never smoked. I use my email client as my aggregator. I came to weblogs from mailing lists, where everything looks the same but you distinguish posters by style and tastes. I tend to only eat plain things and I&#8217;m constantly asked why I&#8217;m so boring and don&#8217;t try exciting new flavors. I enjoy the depth of flavors in the things that normal people would find plain or undistinguishable (microwaved bagels (drool!), pasta, rice, milk). I find Mark&#8217;s current website design unattractive and uncomfortable to read. </p>

<p>Now here are some reasons I think that the full text should be included in the RSS feed: Pages take a while to load. When going through a lot of items, this kind of page loading and context switching can really slow things down. In my email client or desktop aggregator, I can read through the day&#8217;s news without having a live Internet connection. This makes me more productive.</p>

<p>Now here&#8217;s a technical RSS 1.0 note: I suggest keeping excerpts the way they are now in the &lt;description> tag, but using the &lt;content:encoded> tag for a CDATA-encoded version of your HTML. This is what I do for <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/index.xml">my own feed</a> (MT template available upon request). I would like this to be the default setting for MT and other blogging software.</p>
