	<h1>Is the intuitive hypertext interface finally here?</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>The first web browser, Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb">WorldWideWeb</a> was also a Web editor. You visit a page of yours, notice a typo, click edit, fix it, save, and keep on surfing. If you noticed something cool, you&#8217;d hit command-M to copy the address to the clipboard, highlight the text you wanted to be a link, and hit command-L. Surfing and contributing were one.</p>

<p>There are lots of improvements. For example, a nice feature would be to be able to fix things on other people&#8217;s pages and email them a patch. And we would have seen plenty of innovation along the lines of blogs and wikis, where everyone could create Web pages. But we never got to see any of this; the Web never went in that direction. The two-way architecture of the Web (ala Lessig) was lost, because Andreesen and the team at UIUC weren&#8217;t interested in implementing it, even though TimBL flew in and pleaded them to.</p>

<p>[Caveat: My account of the history and WorldWideWeb are probably incorrect in places.]</p>

<p>This has clearly always disturbed TimBL and it saddens me too. TimBL&#8217;s <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Editor">intuitive hypertext editor</a> never came, and instead we&#8217;ve gotten blogs, a poor surrogate. But surprises come from unlikely places. Today I found out about <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/contribute/">Macromedia Contribute</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/1102a.shtml#ala154">According to Zeldman</a> and Macromedia&#8217;s annoying Flash intro, Contribute is a client-side app that lets end-users surf to any page on a site, edit it in Macromedia&#8217;s WYSIWYG editor (tested on teachers, writers, and other non-geeks) and save it to the server using FTP. You can even drag and drop content in from apps like MS Office and it will convert it to sparking XHTML+CSS with the right acessibility attributes and elements. It all sounds like a dream come true.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/email/wishform/">feature request I sent to Macromedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I&#8217;d ask that you consider making a version without the client-designer stuff available at a lower price point. Having that could spark the same kind of two-way-web creativity that easy blogging tools (like Blogger) did, but for all sorts of sites, not just blogs. I find that very exciting, and I hope you do too.</p></blockquote><p>To the two-way Web!</p>
