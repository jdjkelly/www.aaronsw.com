<p><a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory</a> was in town yesterday; it was lots of fun. But this is the first time I can remember that anything related to my technical interests happened in Chicago. For the third largest city in the country, it&#8217;s <em>incredibly</em> boring.</p>

<p>No one lives here: I know at least three people in Phoenix (pop. 1.3M) but I know no one in Chicago (pop. 2.9M). No one holds conferences here: there&#8217;s no one here to come, it&#8217;s too far from Boston and California, and the weather and attractions are lousy. I try to make up for it by attending conferences, but that&#8217;s too expensive to do often. </p>

<p>I think I want to live in San Francisco. There&#8217;s at least one thing I want to attend there or in Silicon Valley every week, there are lots of people there I want to meet and know, there are lots of places and organizations there I want to visit.</p>

<p>But people keep telling me that they&#8217;re trying to get out of there; that it&#8217;s no fun to live in and it&#8217;s too expensive. I&#8217;m not sure it can be worse than here. I don&#8217;t need much to live: really just a bed, an Internet connection, and a power outlet. How much is that? $1500/mo. with a free cardboard box to keep the rain out?</p>
