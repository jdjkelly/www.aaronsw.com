	<h1>The First Ammendment Microwave</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>In <a href="http://cr.yp.to/export/2002/09.03-bernstein-brief.pdf">djb&#8217;s latest brief</a> in his <a href="http://export.cr.yp.to/">export-crypto case</a>, he has an interesting first ammendment argument:</p><blockquote><p>Consider, as a hypothetical example, a book that explains how to use a microwave oven. The book says, in part, &#8220;Press button B; then press button 2; then press button 5; then press Start.&#8221; A cook follows these instructions: he presses B, 2, 5, Start.</p>

<p>Following the instructions is not speech; but writing and publishing the instructions is speech. The First Amendment poses no obstacle to a government regulation of <em>pressing</em> buttons on microwave ovens; but a government regulation of <em>telling people</em> to press buttons on microwave ovens would be content-based and therefore subject to strict scrutiny. Asking &#8220;Is a button sequence fully protected speech?&#8221; would needlessly confuse the <em>publication</em> of a button sequence with the <em>use</em> of a button sequence.</p>

<p>A closer inspection reveals that, when the cook presses buttons, he is actually talking to a small computer inside his microwave oven. He is passing instructions (&#8220;B, 2, 5, Start&#8221;) from the book author to the computer. But this technological detail has no relevance to the First Amendment analysis. The author&#8217;s disclosure of information to the cook is fully protected speech; the cook’s disclosure of information to his oven is a red herring.</p>

<p>The government could argue, exactly as it is arguing in this case, that <em>giving</em> &#8220;instructions to a computer&#8221; are not protected by the First Amendment. It is true that giving instructions to a computer inside a microwave oven is not protected by the First Amendment. But <em>publishing</em> the same instructions, or disclosing the instructions to another person, is fully protected.</p></blockquote><p>I wonder if such an argument would be useful in the DeCSS case.</p>
