<h1>Paul Graham is Wrong</h1>

<p>I really enjoyed that essay by Paul Graham. Paul Graham is an excellent writer and a very nice fellow. But when he said that thing that made me look bad, I just had to draw the line. For years, I&#8217;ve been doing something and telling people I&#8217;m doing it and then all of a sudden Paul Graham comes along and tells me it&#8217;s a bad idea. I think it&#8217;s time to question his assumptions.</p>

<p>In his essay, Graham writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people in this situation typically do this thing. But what if they did this other thing instead? This idea typically doesn&#8217;t occur to them for that reason. But if they did what I suggest, they&#8217;d be like a metaphor instead of a simile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s where Graham really goes off the rails. What if we don&#8217;t want to do what he suggests? Graham never considers that possibility. He just assumes that he&#8217;s right.</p>

<p>Once, in an interview, Graham was asked what he thought about this subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q: What do you think of people doing that thing?</em></p>
  
  <p>Well, you know, historically people really haven&#8217;t done a lot of this thing and going forwards I see a lot more of this thing happening because the things that have stopped people from doing those things no longer exist. This could really change things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is absurd! Just because people <em>can</em> do that thing now doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re going to.</p>

<p>For too long, Paul Graham has gotten a free ride by saying things that disagree with people&#8217;s prejudices in an informative and entertaining manner. That was fine when all we had to do was link to his article and read it. But this time he&#8217;s gone too far: he&#8217;s said something that might actually make me change how I behave. And that&#8217;s unacceptable.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so glad that someone stood up to him finally. Some of what he says at &lt;http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html > such as about Amateurs is a bunch of bull crap. He has also made statements about being an entrepreneur and suggesting that only young people can or should take entrepreneurial risks and that its not such a good idea to do so when you&#8217;re older and have a mortgage and/or a family. FIrst of all, why does everyone who is older need to by paying a bank a mortgage? Hey Paul,  have you ever read the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad?</p>

<p>My father took a calculated risk by starting a business when he was 45 years of age (and yes he had a mortgage and two kids and it wasn&#8217;t always comfortable in the early startup days but his business has lasted him decades). Paul Graham is not &#8220;god&#8221; and some of what he says really ought to not be left unchecked and thank you Aaron for having the guts to stand up to him.</p>

<p>Just to get this clear: Are you&#8217;re saying that telling someone that they have to change how they behave is unacceptable? Or is it more limited: Telling you that you should chance your behavior is unacceptable?</p>

<p>Why is it unacceptable?</p>

<p>From what I read it allright as long as it&#8217;s just ignorable philosophy; But at the moment his philosophy is no longer ignorable, when your get the feeling that you need to make real changes (improvements?) then it&#8217;s allright for you to burn him down in public?</p>

<p>I have to jump up and down and stamp my feet at this outrage of a webpost.</p>

<p>What you&#8217;ve said clearly contravenes what any rational, clear-minded, well-intentioned person would say on this topic.</p>

<p>Several important people have also proved you wrong by expressing contrary opinions and I think that just about wraps it up for you, and, to be frank, those who support you in any manner while you hold such an opinion.</p>

<p>As the learned &#8216;gmlk&#8217; states in the comment preceding this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You sound very american (in the bad 
  imperial way) in this post</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By which i think we can paraphrase his true meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You blah blah American (blah blah Bad 
  blah blah) blah blah blah</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in summary, please retract your statements forthwith or clarify them as actually meaning the opposite or something else altogether, preferably in keeping with whatever i am thinking at the time of your next writing.</p>

<p>sincerely.

<p>I think folks are missing Aaron&#8217;s joke here.</p>

<p>But if they wanted some better essays that take issue with some of PG&#8217;s assertions, you could find them in Eric Sink&#8217;s &#8220;Great Hackers != Great Hires&#8221;:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen less feedback on PG&#8217;s essay on economic inequality (http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html). I&#8217;m guessing because people don&#8217;t take him seriously when he is so far afield of what he knows about.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still trying to decide whether this reads better as intentional simple satire or unintentional self-satire.  I guess it depends on who&#8217;s more intrinsically amusing - the knee-jerk PG haters or the knee-jerk PG lovers.  Is it more ridiculous to assume that PG is wrong when he tells others how to do what they do, or to assume that he&#8217;s right.</p>

<p>OK, I think I have my answer now.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Actually, I didn&#8217;t recognize the quote in any of Paul Grahams essays as well. I read all of them and they really made me think. Paul was the one who drew my attention to LISP actually and since then I am fancying it.
What most people fail to understand is that Paul Graham is a mere mortal and not God. Just the way he expresses his opinions, firm and selfconcious, does not mean he is not reacting to critics. I actually sent him a mail regarding one of his essays where I expressed a different opinion and he could let that stand, he just expressed what he meant when he wrote his statement and that our two opinions were not even diametral.
So I can only suggest to take Pauls essays as what they are, HIS opinions. Think about it, agree, disagree. If you have done that, I think Paul and everyone has won, because we came out of our lazyness and started a dialoque, either with ourselves of even with him.
So write him your opinions and I am sure he will  think about it, send you an answer and take your opinion into account when writing his next essay.
This is the way science, society and about everything evolves : by dialoque !</p>

<p>Someone on this thread commented about PG&#8217;s essay on economic inequality.  Now, not to start a flamewar, but I don&#8217;t see anything objectionable about the essay.  Most of what it says is basically true, and what of the essay that might be contested is just stating stuff that most people don&#8217;t want to hear.  It&#8217;s focus is more to discuss startups, of which he does have experience.  I personally wish PG would stop writing editorials, (though he has much better taste in programming languages than a group of java programmers who were trashing him on their blogs because they probably haven&#8217;t considered using anything but java.) I&#8217;m getting sick of his narsicsstic/strawman writing style.</p>

<p>But please don&#8217;t compare him to ESR.  He is 100x the hacker that guy was, or ever would be.  I just wish he&#8217;d stop pigeonholing everything with his unbalanced essays&#8230; (though I will say, he got me interested in Common Lisp about 6 years ago).</p>

<p>Anyway, he definitely knows what he&#8217;s talking about in computer science, but I wish he&#8217;d stop it with this &#8220;hackers are this/that&#8221; mumbo jumbo.</p>

<p>If you have to resort to that level of snobbery, I&#8217;m sorry, but Paul Graham has never stooped to that level.</p>
