<p>I enjoyed Plover&#8217;s <a href="http://perl.plover.com/yak/#pjudo">Conference Presentation Judo</a>. I especially like how he gets rid of the <a href="http://perl.plover.com/yak/judo/presentation/slide017.html">repeat yourself three times</a> thing. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been slowly giving more and more talks so I&#8217;m trying to improve my public speaking habits. It&#8217;s hard to tell how well I&#8217;m doing because people say nice things about every talk. Although I work really hard to be clear and informative, it&#8217;s hard to believe I&#8217;m any good. </p>

<p>I guess the solution is to go to good presentations and pick up their styles. (Hopefully I can do some of this at OSCON.) I really like Steve Jobs&#8217; presenting style (slides should be as simple as possible and illustrate not narrate). Too bad I never got an opportunity to hear Edward <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/backissues/joho-dec18-00.html">&#8220;Power corrupts. PowerPoint corrupts absolutely.&#8221;</a> Tufte <a href="http://mappa.mundi.net/trip-m/tufte/">speak</a> because I expect his advice would be pretty good. The price was prohibitively expensive and I already had the expensive books but they wouldn&#8217;t give me any discount if I didn&#8217;t take them. I have the same problem with the upcoming <a href="http://www.37signals.com/workshop.php">contigency design workshop from 37signals</a>.</p>

<p>However, after suffering thru a series of let-me-read-useless-facts-that-you-can-already-see-from-the-garishly-colored-powerpoint-on-the-screen presentations at school I have some sense of what not to do. But getting things right is quite hard. I&#8217;d appreciate advice other people have.</p>

<p>I guess a similar thing is going on with this weblog. I&#8217;m experimenting with different styes and kind folks (notably CoryD and RussS) are pushing me in the right direction. It&#8217;s hard to find the balance between linking to interesting things and going on boring rants or crusades. Again, let me know if it&#8217;s working or you have suggestions.</p>
