<h1>Do It Now</h1>

<p>A year or two ago, I came up with a brilliant scheme for handling my email. The problem, I decided, was that there was just too much of it. Spam was mixed in with notes from friends along with important things from work and todo items I&#8217;d written to myself. What I needed to do was go thru and sort it &#8212; pick out the really important stuff to handle right away and move the junk to the bottom. So I wrote a little program that would let me go through and sort my email into neat little folders ordered by priority.</p>

<p>Well, here&#8217;s what happened: I sorted all my email, and then I didn&#8217;t answer any of it. I told myself that I shouldn&#8217;t answer the unimportant stuff until the important stuff was taken care of, then when I looked at the important stuff it seemed hard, so I decided to go read some blogs first. To this day, all those important emails are just sitting there.</p>

<p>Recently, I came up with a really dumb system for handling my email: just do it. I&#8217;d start at the top of my inbox, answer the most recent email, and move on to the next one. No excuses. No matter what the email at the top was &#8212; no matter how difficult or awkward or unimportant, I had to answer it. I couldn&#8217;t move on to another email and come back to it later. I had to answer the most recent email, no matter what it was.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, I&#8217;d answered a month&#8217;s worth of email.</p>

<p>We procrastinate because we are afraid. We&#8217;re afraid it&#8217;s too much work and that it will drain us. We&#8217;re afraid we&#8217;ll screw it up and get in trouble. We&#8217;re afraid we don&#8217;t know how to do it. We&#8217;re afraid because, well, we&#8217;ve been putting it off forever and every time we put it off it seems a little more fearsome in our minds. That&#8217;s why not putting things off is so liberating. We&#8217;re forced to confront our fears, not let them grow bigger by repeatedly running away. And when we confront them, we find they&#8217;re not so scary after all.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t just apply to email, of course &#8212; it works for any todo list. But only if you say no to reordering, prioritizing, estimating deadlines, and doing the most important things first. Forget all that. Do it now.</p>

<p>How to do that ? How to convince &#8220;ourselves&#8221; to do right stuff on right time ?? This is the point &#8230;</p>

<p>very true&#8230; however the counter argument is that if you plow through your list completing items as fast as possible, you may not be completing them in the optimal manner. That&#8217;s why we procrastinate on the important emails; because sending a hasty reply could have a large negative cost.</p>

<p>The trick is knowing which items you can knock out ASAP and which items require further rumination.</p>

<p>Another factor with email is that once it has sat in your inbox for long enough, sending a reply, no matter how well crafted, will seem rude. Therefore email has a inherent lifespan (maybe 2 weeks?). After that you can just delete/archive it with impunity.</p>

<p>I use gmail, get around 20 emails per day, and I always quickly scan through visually to find and answer the important emails first. Never had a problem with that. Sometimes it could be overwhelming, I agree, but I would still say you need to &#8216;prioritize&#8217; rather than &#8216;moving from one email to another&#8217; in a linear fashion. (from most recently received first). Some emails can take their time for our answers. Others need immediate replies.</p>

<p>Given that Aaron said:  &#8220;I wrote a little program that would let me go through and sort my email into neat little folders ordered by priority.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mohan Arun then said:  &#8220;I would still say you need to ‘prioritize’.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the world exploded.</p>

I&#8217;ve always done it this way. I also immediately throw away mails I know I will never answer or is not needed to act upon.</p>

<p>Extremely few mails actually contains information that I might need later - and those that do is often sent to me by myself. Those are saved in folders (ideas, programming, friends etc).</p>

<p>I think sometimes it&#8217;s better to get the easy stuff done first because it takes not much time and having a few things off your list will give you a feeling of accomplishment. But your mileage will vary depending on the severity of your procrastination habits.</p>

<p>What you are doing with your inbox is in direct relation to the &#8220;Getting Things Done&#8221; methodology by David Allen.  I would recommend you grab his book (called &#8220;Getting Things Done&#8221; &#8212; obviously) and give it a read.  It may help you figure out a system to make you more productive and less stressed&#8230;</p>

<p>I am biased since I am currently working on a product that helps people with Getting Things Done - especially from a product development point of view (software product).</p>

<p>The branding on &#8220;Just Do It&#8221; is unfortunate, because it is such an awesome phrase.</p>

<p>Caveat on just doing your email: you need to not have your email open all day. Pick a time, and get through it. Let SMS be your interrupt-if-urgent messaging system.</p>

<p>I totally agree. I reached this same conclusion myself not too long ago, and it has really made me more productive and focused (as a programmer).</p>

<p>Thanks for nicely summing this up :)</p>

<p>Who uses email much anymore? I find it weird that in 2010 people still get a lot of email.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve notice that the number of emails I get has dropped precipitously in the past few years to the point that I only get one or two a day now that are actually looking for a response.   Generally team members communicate via IM.</p>

<p>You discovered the first step to productivity.</p>

<p>In 30 years you will discover 5 more and you will be really productive.</p>

<p>Or you can read David Allen&#8217;s &#8220;Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity&#8221; and have it all now.</p>

<p>It took me 15 years to get there half way (3 steps) and 2 days reading for the full road. Re-inventing the wheel does not pay.</p>

<p>Good one. Only thing I&#8217;d add is that you occasionally can&#8217;t fully handle an email because it requires more work, or research, or some other dependency&#8230; in that case best thing to do is forward it to a todo list and then get it out of the email inbox.</p>

<p>More on that method, btw, in my book &#8220;Bit Literacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>work and personal email are different for me.  at work, i have the 3 month rule: i keep 3 months of emails in my inbox, so i can search for stuff, and file a few things that i know i will need later.  then i just dump everything older than 3 months.  i don&#8217;t email many people for much more than scheduling things and followups.  i use SMS whenever possible for urgent things (system alerts, communications with the boss, etc.)</p>

<p>email has no tone of voice, making it prone to mis-understandings and it&#8217;s admissible in court, so you should use it sparingly in a professional setting.</p>

<p>my personal email is the opposite.  i use gmail so i just search for stuff, and only delete things like daily automated emails from job search sites or shopping sites.  i don&#8217;t even delete mailing list traffic.</p>

<p>personal and business communications is a tool box.  email is just one tool and it has a proper use.  it is a supplement to, not a substitute for, the phone, SMS, IM, social networking, or a face to face conversation.</p>

<p>I have an even more efficient way to deal with email that I discovered in, admittedly, a moment of severe frustration; just delete them all.  If ever a pile gets so long that I can&#8217;t even remember when I stopped completing items, I&#8217;ll delete them all.</p>

<p>If the information is truly that important, then either it&#8217;ll be resent in one form or another back to you, or you&#8217;ll eventually be prompted to go out and search for it out of necessity.</p>

<p>I heard a similar thought-process called &#8220;FAT&#8221; File-Act-Trash. You take your queue and for each item you <em>have</em> to do one of those three things.</p>

<p>To those who are still tempted to use some sort of advanced scheme after reading this post: Yes, advanced schemes can be good, but you&#8217;re still better off following Aaron&#8217;s advice for a short spell before planning one out.  By doing this you will get a better idea of the sort of problem you are dealing with.  Implementing an advanced scheme for a task you haven&#8217;t done much of or having done in a while is premature optimization.</p>
