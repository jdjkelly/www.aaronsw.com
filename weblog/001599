	<h1>The Republican Playbook</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>When commenters suggested it was unfair to <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001588">compare Republicans to astrologists</a>, I thought I might have to write a post with some basic facts about the election: only 6% of Bush voters decided based on &#8220;agendas/ideas/platforms/goals&#8221; (13% for Kerry voters), those that did were mistaken on many of the key facts they used to decide (e.g. thinking we found WMDs or that al-Qaeda and Saddam worked together), that even then the candidate planned to do the opposite of what they thought he would. Thankfully, this task has since become unnecessary. First, because it&#8217;s already been quite ably done in <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=6751">this article on the 2004 elections</a> and second, because the Republicans have conceded the point. </p>

<p>Frank Luntz is a chief Reppublican strategist. His company, the Luntz Research Corporation, advises major companies and top Republican politicians on how to talk. Luntz&#8217;s methods &#8212; which he has been ahppy to describe in numerous interviews &#8212; are simple: take a topic, think up a number of ways to lie about it, record someone saying them, play the recording for an audience, and ask the audience which lie was most convincing. (Luntz then, of course, tells the person hiring him to use that convincing lie.)</p>

<p>Every so often, Luntz packages up the combined results of all this &#8220;research&#8221; into a strategy book which is then distributed to all the Republican operatives so that they can use the most effective terminology. Well, this year, we managed to get a copy of the briefing book. The liberal weblog Daily Kos has <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/images/user/3/luntz.zip">posted a scan of the book</a> [8MB ZIP of two PDFs] and by reading it we can see precisely how the Republicans won.</p>

<p>Luntz begins (literally&#8212;this is the very first line) with a question most Democrats must be asking themselves:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So how does a President with a national job approval rating hovering at 50%, an economy that lost more than a million jobs over his four years in office, a war that has cost more than a thousand American lives and counting, $50 a barrel for oil, and a national mood that is downright sour still secure more than enough votes to win re-election?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer, Luntz explains, is simple: fear and lies. Now Luntz isn&#8217;t completely stupid, he calls these credibility and hope, but it&#8217;s clear from the definitions what he really means. (In the same way, Luntz says his focus groups are about learning how to understand Americans, not lie to them, but it&#8217;s clear from the videotapes that have been made of the sessions exactly what&#8217;s going on.) On fear, for example, Luntz writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, the Democrats have clung to a desperate belief that Bush won because he waged a campaign of fear. The exact opposite was the case. Americans turned to him precisely because they saw him as the antidote to that fear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that exactly what Democrats mean by a campaign of fear? What candidate runs on the platform that they&#8217;ll continue to scare people after they win?</p>

<p>In the rest of the book, Luntz goes on to give details about how these principles of fear and lies can be applied. In the section on the economy for example, Luntz recommends Republicans stay away from &#8220;using facts and figures&#8221; and instead mention 9/11. And for energy policy, Luntz recommends you &#8220;never say: drilling for oil; instead say: exploring for energy&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s &#8220;the difference between &#8230; black goop vs. 21st Century technology and innovation&#8221; that will save us from being dependent on the Middle East.</p>

<p>It goes on and on like this for 160 pages  &#8212; first, use lovable but vague terms, then mention scary consequences. Lies and fear, lies and fear. Luntz even occasionally concedes as much. For example, after he talks about how Republicans should speak in vague terms about &#8220;frivolous lawsuits&#8221; caused by &#8220;national greed&#8221;, he gives an example of a possible Democrat&#8217;s response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When innocent people who are injured seek compensation from those who caused their injuries, it&#8217;s anything but frivolous. When a preventable careless medical error forces a child into a wheelchair for the rest of his life, it&#8217;s anything but frivolous. And when someone close to you suffers due to doctor negligence, their right to a day  in court is anything but frivolous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luntz recommends changing the subject back to &#8220;<em>fraud</em> and <em>abuse</em>&#8221; (emphasis in original) if this happens.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point should be clear: the Americans Luntz is targeting are voting Republican not because they hold some different set of core values or beliefs, but because they were successfully deceived and scared. To use this success at deceiving the public as an excuse to get more conservative operatives into universities, where they can then deceive the public further, is just so blatantly absurd and offensive that I can hardly think of words to describe it. </p>

<p>Do you really think that Luntz and the Republican Party propogandists were that effective? If so, you may be giving them a little more credit than they deserve.</p>

<p>Aren&#8217;t elections everywhere basically just personality contests? And do you think most American voters really know or care any more about issues than do most high-school students who vote in elections for student-body presidents? If so, you may be giving them a lot more credit than they deserve.</p>

<p>Perhaps the main reason the Democratic Party lost the election is that they chose to put forth a candidate who the majority of American voters found less likeable than Bush. And maybe the election would have gone very differently if the party had managed to give voters a candidate with a personality that appealed to middle Americans.</p>

<p>The Republican Party understands that. They learned their lesson with Bush I and Robert Dole. George W. Bush was handpicked by Karl Rove and friends in large part because they recognized that he had a personality that would appeal to American voters. And they proved that a winning candidate does not need to be particularly smart at all or have a particularly long record of successes inside or outside of politics.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party leadership needs to wake up and figure out how to do the same thing: Identify and groom prospects who have personalities that appeal to the kind of people who enjoy shopping at Wal-Mart, and see that money makes its way into their campaigns. Their current strategy &#8212; letting the primary elections get fought and won by the candidates who have the most money to spend &#8212; isn&#8217;t completely bad; it&#8217;s just that they need to make sure that money is getting put behind someone who actually has a chance of winning the personality contest.</p>

<p>Maybe the party should try recruiting movie stars. If Arnold Schwarzenegger, with zero prior political experience, can get elected to be governer of California, I reckon the Democratic Party might have a pretty good chance of getting someone like Harrison Ford elected as President.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a couple of items to consider.</p>

<p>1)  An article by Paul Graham suggesting that in modern America, politics and issues have much less to do with winning elections than does good ol&#8217; fashion charisma (as a hyper-marketed gen-x I tend to agree):</p>

<p>http://store.yahoo.com/paulgraham/recharisma.html</p>

<p>2)  A recent article by John Leo in U.S. News and World Report about the state of Liberalism in America.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the last couple of paragraphs:</p>

<p>&#8220;For a stark vision of what cultural liberalism has come to, consider the breakdown of the universities, the fortresses of the 1960s cultural liberals and their progeny. Students are taught that objective judgments are impossible. All knowledge is compromised by issues of power and bias. Therefore, there is no way to come to judgment about anything, since judgment itself rests on quicksand. This principle, however, is suspended when the United States and western culture are discussed, because the West is essentially evil and guilty of endless crimes. Better to declare a vague transnational identity and admiration for the United Nations. The campuses indulge in heavy coercion and indoctrination. A sign of the times: The University of California&#8217;s academic assembly eliminated the distinction between &#8220;interested&#8221; and &#8220;disinterested&#8221; scholarship by a 45-to-3 vote. The campuses are politicized, and they don&#8217;t care who knows it. Harvard is all atwitter because its president ran afoul of local orthodoxy, suggesting, ever so tentatively, that sexual differences might be a factor in careers in science.</p>

<p>In their bafflement over rejection of their product, liberals have been lacing speeches with religious phrases and asking mainstream Americans to vote their economic interests by rejecting Republican fat cats. It will take a bit more than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/050307/opinion/7john.htm</p>

<p>Perhaps there are other, much simpler, forces at play.</p>

<p>I was in college with Frank Luntz; I remember him in at least one history of science class. At Penn, the history of science program was heavily influenced by the then-novel sociology of knowledge. I&#8217;ve sometimes wondered if Frank picked up his, shall we say, epistemological flexibility, from that class. Certainly he&#8217;s demonstrated a tactical sensibility about controversies, language, and rhetoric that puts the hardest-core social constructivist to shame. Academics thought they were being really clever about the nature of knowledge when they made he case that social and political factors influence the production of knowledge; the Right takes the same concept and turns it into a playbook. &#8220;Yes, reality is a social construct; but it&#8217;s OUR social construct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regarding the last comment, linguist George Lakoff of Stanford has noted something similar.  For a politician&#8212;and not just a politician&#8212;the important thing is how the issue is framed, so that you get the response what you want.  The issue itself is irrelevant.</p>

<p>This may be a consequence of the tendency of many people to think in terms of trigger words &#8212; or more commonly called &#8220;thought-terminating clich&eacute;s&#8221;. So, for example, when they see a message containing words like &#8220;open-minded&#8221;, &#8220;<a href="http://ghettographics.org/bi/gloss.html#lex_freedom">freedom</a>&#8221;, &#8220;Founding Fathers&#8221; etc. they start going all doubleplusbellyfeelgood and go into a swoon and take off all their clothes in preparation for a rapturous experience, and when they see a message containing words like &#8220;closed-minded&#8221;, &#8220;control&#8221;, &#8220;<a href="http://ghettographics.org/bi/gloss.html#lex_nazi">Nazis</a>&#8221; etc. they immediately go into an uncontrollable rage and arm themselves to the hilt for a fierce battle with the Evil Forces That Be. The rest of the message isn&#8217;t even considered. Thus a message like &#8220;It&#8217;s obviously the intention of the Founding Fathers that Iran be bombed to smithereens&#8221; will immediately trigger a response like &#8220;Yeah! Go! Go! God Bless America!&#8221;</p>

<p>With this sort of thinking around, is it surprising that framing works so easily and so well?</p>

<p>How is this any different than abortion rights proponents referring to those who oppose them as &#8220;anti-choice&#8221;? Or homosexual activists referring to anyone who opposes them as &#8220;homophobic&#8221;?</p>

<p>How is this &#8220;lying&#8221;?</p>

<p>It seems to me that your real problem is not the substance of what Luntz does (after all, it&#8217;s pretty much what any modern marketer does for his/her &#8220;product&#8221;), but the fact that he&#8217;s so much more effective than the people you support.</p>

<p>I think the pro-life/pro-choice thing is absurd. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re referring to with the &#8220;homosexual activists&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m against marketers too &#8212; I have consistently opposed &#8220;the PR industry [whose] guiding principle is deceit whether they are &#8220;undermining the fanciful markets of doctrine&#8221; or &#8220;undermining democracy&#8221;. </p>

<p>I agree that some of Luntz&#8217;s more vague terminology is akin to the absurd car commercials that imply their product will make you sexier; you may not wish to call that a lie. But there&#8217;s no doubt that most of the facts and figures Republicans use are just outright lies &#8212; look no further than the Social Security claims being made as of late. (One example &#8212; Bush saying Social Security will go &#8220;flat bust&#8221; in 2042 when, by the most conservative estimates, it will actually be paying out more than it does now.)</p>

<p>And Luntz directly cites the Swift Boat ads as having a significant effect &#8212; again, clear lies.</p>

<p>Bryan&#8217;s comments look like another case of referring to the &#8216;stereotypical&#8217; Leftist. There&#8217;s a tendency for extremist ideologues to lump all their opponents together into one huge group, and treat any trait from any random person as a trait of the whole group. So, because some stupid extremist feminists think &#8220;women&#8221; should be spelt &#8220;womyn&#8221;, therefore <i>all</i> feminists are like that, and therefore <i>all</i> Leftists are babbling idiots.</p>

<p>In contrast, the lies coming from the Bush administration are obviously coming from a single source, namely the White House.</p>

<p>Glad to fit your stereotype. Just for the record:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I don&#8217;t know how you infer from my comment that I am an &#8220;extremist ideologue.&#8221; Perhaps some projection.</p></li>
<li><p>The references I made were not to &#8220;any random person,&#8221; but to leaders (NARAL comes to mind, although search NOW&#8217;s site and you can find plenty of &#8220;anti-choice&#8221; terminology).</p></li>
<li><p>I didn&#8217;t refer to any leftist as a &#8220;babbling idiot.&#8221; That&#8217;s your hang-up.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The split between &#8220;pro-choice&#8221; and &#8220;pro-life&#8221; is a long-standing, well-documented instance of the tug-of-war over language used in framing debate over controversial topics. The use of &#8220;homophobia&#8221; to demonize anyone who disagrees with the aims of homosexual activists is likewise well-known. As is the tendency to refer to anyone who disagrees with affirmative action as &#8220;racist.&#8221; </p>

<p>Your suggestion that &#8220;any random person&#8221; says these things is patently untrue. These are textbook examples of the use of language to disparage opposing viewpoints.</p>

<p>But to Luntz, I cannot say that I find anything inherently evil in wanting to frame the debate in the way that is most positive to your side. I think democrats and republicans play these games all the time. Republicans use their code words, democrats use theirs.</p>

<p>And extremist ideologues have theirs.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s obvious that this is how the Republicans won the election.  While John Kerry may not have been the most charismatic candidate the Dems could have put forth, I don&#8217;t believe that was the main reason for the loss.  I&#8217;ve said repeatedly that the Repubs won this with a simple strategy: pick several simple lies, and tell them over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and then tell them again.<p>
The average American is too stupid to be bothered with insignificant things like facts.  Here&#8217;s the recipe:<ul>
<li>simplicity
<li>repetition
<li>pinch of God
</li></li></li></ul>
Mix well and place in large container of southern Simpleton coated with Rove/Rice/Cheney grease.<p>
The Dems lost because we appealed to the intellect &#8212; same reason (besides the flagrant illegal manipulation of the vote) that Gore lost in 2000.  That just doesn&#8217;t work.  To win in 2008, or to get that idiot out of the White House prior to then, we need simple messages that the average Joe and Josephine can grasp and repeat.<ul>
<li>Bush is stealing your social security
<li>Bush is destroying America&#8217;s education system
<li>Bush is killing our soldiers in an unnecessary war
<li>Bush is running this country into debt
<li>Bush is making the rich richer
<li>Bush is making your prescriptions more expensive
</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
&#8230;and so on.  And the thing is, things like this are objectively provable!  So we don&#8217;t need to dip into the well of lies like our opponents; just tell the truth in a <b>simple</b> way.<p>
The Republicans grasped this reality quite some time ago.</p></p></p></p>

The same reason the other side calls themselves &#8220;pro-life&#8221; instead of &#8220;anti-abortion&#8221; (which is actually a more accurate description than &#8220;anti-choice,&#8221; since one has to assume that 95 percent of the women who have abortions made a &#8220;choice&#8221; when they decided to have unprotected sexual intercourse).</p>

<p>And one only has to read Michael&#8217;s more-intellectual-than-thou &#8220;the American people are too stupid&#8221; screed to understand exactly why the Democrats continue to lose elections. The American people are not too stupid to understand when they are being talked down to by elitist ideologues.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you might want to examine the terminology and game plan used by Sen. Kerry (calling him &#8220;not the most charismatic pick&#8221; is the understatement of the year) as opposed to the terminology and game plan used by the Rethugnican Rovistas.</p>

<p>But finally, the Dems would do well to focus on their race, their message, and their purpose beyond obstruction of the opposition. Continuing to flog the dead horse of the 2004 and 2000 elections make you look like incredibly sore losers. </p>

<p>Enough already. Articulate what you stand for and focus on those simple things.</p>

<p><em>But finally, the Dems would do well to focus on their race, their message, and their purpose&#8230;</em><p>
Bryan, I couldn&#8217;t agree with you more!  But flogging was not my purpose.  Here, I&#8217;ll put it in more simple terms so that I&#8217;m not branded as an &#8220;elitist idealogue&#8221;: the GOP won with simple, understandable (though not truthful) messages.  The Dems would do well to emulate that strategy.<p>Making an intellectual appeal, however, is <em>not</em> the same thing as being supercilious, which is how I interpret your retort.  You seem to imply that making a well-constructed, rational, logical argument is tantamount to being snobbish and arrogant, viewed much the same way as the &#8220;goddamn college kids&#8221; are viewed by the town locals.  The reality is that most folk are moved more by simple appeals to emotions than by logic &#8212; no matter how compelling.<p>I don&#8217;t think my statement that &#8220;Americans are too stupid&#8230;&#8221; is being elitist, snobbish, or condescending.  It&#8217;s just fact.  To wit: 64% of folks still believe that there were strong ties between Saddam and Al Qaeda, and <a href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=544">47% still believe</a> that he helped plan the 9/11 attacks.  This in the face of a bi-partisan congressional report finding no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/shoulders/senateiraqconclusions.pdf">(see conclusion 96)</a>.  What other conclusion can you draw when people refuse to believe objective evidence?</p></p></p><p>And I believe completely in articulating what we stand for.  I think it&#8217;s well past time the Dems stopped being wishy-washy and just put it on the line: <ul><li> We believe in equal rights for all, not just for the ones your faith tells you deserve rights<li>We believe that a free, fantastic, fully-funded, fenomenal (love that alliteration, and yes, I know how to really spell it) education is one of the most fundamental rights for all<li>We <em>truly</em> believe in freedom of religion, and not foisting our beliefs on others<li>We believe in social justice and helping others achieve prosperity<li>We believe in a global community, and not in isolating ourselves</li></li></li></li></li></ul>It&#8217;s time to make a stand.</p></p>

<p><em>On the other hand, “pro-choice” isn’t exactly accurate for the anti-abortion people (<strong>I assume here you mean &#8220;pro-life&#8221; - ed.</strong>) - because most of them support the death penalty and war.

<p>Okay, how about &#8220;pro-baby&#8221;?</p>

<p>But as to your argument that being pro-death penalty is &#8220;pro-death,&#8221; there are arguments contrary to that statement, but I don&#8217;t think anyone wants this to veer off into an argument about the death penalty. So I&#8217;ll just note that a significant number of people who are &#8220;pro-life/anti-abortion&#8221; are also against the death penalty and war. Those are not mutuallly exclusive positions to hold, much as you&#8217;d like to make them so.</p>

<p><em>Maybe because they aren’t actually “pro-abortion”? I don’t know anyone who is pro-abortion. They are for the right for woman to choose to have an abortion, or not to have an abortion. they don’t want to force every woman to have an abortion - they want to allow individual women to make their own decisions over their own bodies.</em></p>

<p>Actually, the qualm of most people who oppose abortion on demand is that the woman has <em>already</em> made a decision with  her body - usually to have unprotected sexual intercourse, which leads often to unwanted pregancies. The sticky wicket is not <em>choice,</em> but the involvement of another life - that of the baby (fetus, to use the pro-abortion terminology).</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s not quite so simple as the &#8220;pro-choice&#8221; side being simply in favor of a woman&#8217;s right to &#8220;do what she wants&#8221; with her body. They specifically want the right to choose <em>one thing</em> to that body, and that involves destroying another human life.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m perfectly willing to admit that there are logical inconsistencies in the &#8220;rape, incest and health of the mother&#8221; exemption that is part of compromise position proposed by some anti-abortion activists, I note no similar acknowledgement that there is an inherent inconsistency in abortion rights proponents who are perfectly willing to accept abortion <em>up to</em> a certain point in the process. It seems like if you want women to have a choice of abortion, that choice should extend up to birth, no? Maybe I&#8217;m missing something.</p>

<p>If you really know what I prefer, I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with either term. &#8220;Abortion rights activists/proponents&#8221; and &#8220;Anti-abortion activists&#8221; would seem to be more correct on both sides.</p>

<p>First, what&#8217;s up with the &#8220;penetrated women&#8221; bit? Are you saying that all of these women had no say in the matter? That it&#8217;s all the man&#8217;s fault that these women were impregnated? </p>

<p>As the old saying goes: &#8220;It takes two to tango.&#8221;</p>

<p>RE: the other 5 percent. Who said I was ignoring them? I wouldn&#8217;t dream of &#8220;glossing over&#8221; the horrible experience of rape, sexual abuse or incest. Which is also why a large percentage of those who oppose abortion are willing to grant exceptions in the case of rape, incest and the life of the mother. Making such an exception hardly qualifies as an open gate for the other 95 percent, however.</p>

<p>And just FWIW, I should note that I&#8217;m fortunate to have been born prior to Roe v. Wade, as I know for a fact that I would have probably been a statistic were I born five years later.</p>

<p>The &#8220;pro-choice&#8221; position doesn&#8217;t have any logical inconsistency. It&#8217;s perfectly logical to say that a foetus isn&#8217;t considered a human life (and thus the mother has a choice) until a certain point, after which it is considered human (and thus the mother has no choice).</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t do that with the &#8220;pro-life&#8221; position minus &#8220;rape, sexual abuse or incest&#8221;. That&#8217;s because this position says that murder is <i>always</i> wrong, and abortion is <i>always</i> murder. If so, then why&#8217;s it suddenly OK for a raped girl to abort her baby? If abortion isn&#8217;t always murder, or murder isn&#8217;t always wrong, then what exactly are the moral foundations again?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time to rethink your position to get rid of the inconsistency, instead of being smug about it.</p>

<p><i>Okay, how about “pro-baby”?</i></p>

<p>Many of them will proceed to religiously indoctrinate their children, or feed them poor diets (including Coca-Cola) - or otherwise neglect or mistreat their children. Hardly pro-baby in every case.</p>

<p><i>Actually, the qualm of most people who oppose abortion on demand is that the woman has already made a decision with her body - usually to have unprotected sexual intercourse, which leads often to unwanted pregancies.</i></p>

<p>So, pregnancy only happens out of choice? Did you know that a large number of women are raped? Did you know that condoms break, and other contraception methods fail?</p>

<p>Also, having unprotected sex does not reliquish the ability to make decisions over the body. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean having a child. the pro-choice camp wants to allow the choice of abortion, even if the woman had unprotected sex.</p>

<p>How is that not &#8220;pro-choice&#8221;?</p>

<p><i>So I’ll just note that a significant number of people who are “pro-life/anti-abortion” are also against the death penalty and war. Those are not mutuallly exclusive positions to hold, much as you’d like to make them so.</i></p>

<p>I never said they were mutually exclusive. Just that a <b>majority</b> of &#8220;pro-life&#8221; people support this position. Otherwise, why would they vote for Bush&#8217;s platform in such large numbers? Remember all the deaths that Bush signed off on when he was Governor of Texas, and now that he is sending Americans to die in Iraq, and killing even more Iraqi children?</p>

<p>Do you have any idea of the number of babies being killed in Iraq? How can anyone who supports the war, be considered &#8220;pro-baby&#8221; - when the consequence of supporting the war is to allow thousands of babies and children to be slaughtered?</p>

<p><i>They specifically want the right to choose one thing to that body, and that involves destroying another human life.</i></p>

<p><b>Or the choice NOT to do it.</b> It does not specifically involve killing anything. And legally, the fetus is not a human life. that&#8217;s quite a strong contention. At that point, the &#8220;baby&#8221; is merely a collection of cells that is a part of the mother&#8217;s body. It is not a separate life.</p>

<p>In some cases, not having an abortion will kill BOTH the baby and the mother - so having an abortion results in a greater loss of life. (if you consider the fetus to be a &#8220;life&#8221; of its own.</p>

<p><i>I should note that I’m fortunate to have been born prior to Roe v. Wade, as I know for a fact that I would have probably been a statistic were I born five years later.</i></p>

<p>What makes you &#8220;fortunate&#8221;? You would never have known the difference if you were terminated. Why would you have been aborted? because your mother wasn&#8217;t in a good position to take care of you? If so, then your birth has probably damaged her life, for the sake of your own.</p>

<p>One day, the fateful predictions made in the Schwarzenegger films will come to pass, and men will have the ability to get pregnant (as well as much of the human race will be destroyed by the weapons we&#8217;ve created turning against us).
