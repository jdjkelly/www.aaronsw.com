<div class="content">
<p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000725">As I noted previously</a>, rillian sent me a copy of <cite>The Elements of Typographic Style</cite> by Robert Bringhurst. It&#8217;s an absolutely <em>beautiful</em> book. When I opened it up the other day to look something up, I could hear the Brandenburg Concertos, some of my favorite music, in my mind&#8217;s ear. That&#8217;s how beautiful this book is.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;ve realized since reading it is that publishing documents on the Web, no less than preparing them for publication as a book, is typography and deserves the same care as that noble craft. There are some differences, to be sure, but the core it&#8217;s about making the meaning of the text shine through the words, a craft that has been practiced for ages.</p>

<p>Bringhurst has a style of writing that&#8217;s a joy to read, and I&#8217;ve taken the liberty of <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/typographicStyle">quoting some of my favorite portions</a>. I highly recommend that anyone with an interest in writing for the Web reads them, and perhaps the book too.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that for all the care Bringhurst put into the visual design of the book, the functional design is lacking. (This is a pattern I see elsewhere as well: even the most beautiful web pages can be a pain to use. Of course, this too is <a href="http://notabug.com/qweb/">something I hope to fix</a>.) Partly because of the books unique (and attractive) shape, it does not lie flat at all. Holding it open was such a strain that my hand begun to ache. Furthermore, the flaps on the side, presumably for bookmarking a page, ended up crushing it instead. But that aside, the content and form of the book is superb, some of the best I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
