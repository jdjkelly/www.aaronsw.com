	<h1>What&#8217;s Good on TV</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>For many years I proudly avoided TV. Everything I saw on it was, to a greater or lesser extent, boring and anti-intellectual. This was so pervasive that I became convinced it was a flaw of the medium itself: television (I figured), with its constant commercial breaks and 44 minute cap, had nothing to teach us and was incapable of communicating emotion. Then I discovered Buffy.</p>

<p>Here was a show that communicated drama, emotion, life lessons, and facts, while doing it with beauty, grace, and humor. I was hooked.</p>

<p>Good television is out there. It’s hard to find, not taken seriously, ignored by the critics, and quickly canceled by the networks, but it’s out there and it’s wonderful.</p>

<p>Without out further ado, here’s <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/tv">what’s good on TV</a> (<a href="mailto:tv@aaronsw.com">your contributions appreciated</a>).</p>

<p>A special note on <em>the West Wing</em>: after I watched <em>Buffy</em> and <em>24</em>, I noticed this show’s name popping up everywhere. I watched a couple episodes and it looked interesting, but not interesting enough for me to try and download or buy all four seasons of it like I did with <em>Buffy</em>. Soon after I decided this, I noticed that Bravo announcing it was going to run an episode of West Wing, starting with the very first all the way up to the current season, four days a week. I started watching and was quickly hooked. After watching the whole first season, I’m in love with the combination of comedy, drama, and political subjects I’m interested in.</p>

<p>Lucky for you, you can watch all the episodes too. Starting Monday, Bravo will be <a href="http://westwing.bewarne.com/extras/bravoschedule.html">showing all the first season episodes again at 11AM Bravo time</a> (conversion to local time depends on cable provider). If it sounds like the kind of thing that interests you, set your VCR/PVR.</p>
