<p>Adrian Hamilton: <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/adrian_hamilton/story.jsp?story=322726">Yes, we need a &#8216;regime change&#8217; in this rogue state&#8230;</a>.</p><blockquote><p>The government which is spending by far the most on weapons of mass destruction, and is now planning to raise its budget by an increase greater than the total defence spending of Europe, is, of course, based in Washington. Not only is it building an arsenal the like of which the world has never seen, it has unilaterally withdrawn from the treaties designed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons, and has refused to accept any kind of international monitoring of its chemical or nuclear weapons facilities.</p>

<p>It has a government in power without the legitimacy of a democratic majority, in the hands of a coterie from a single part of the country and clearly aiming at a dynasty of rule. Its rhetoric is one of violent aggression against anyone seen as its enemies. It opponents are locked up without trial or the right to habeas corpus.</p>

<p>[&#8230;]  A period of occupation of five to 10 years could provide an opportunity to inculcate ideas of true democracy, with a fair electoral system based on absolute majority, abolition of the death penalty, introduction of unions into hi-tech industries and a break-up of the Zaibatsu, the overweening corporations such as Microsoft, Exxon and General Electric.</p>

<p>Given time, this rogue superstate might then be able to take its place once again among the family of peace-loving nations.</p></blockquote><p>Please! Come save us!</p>
