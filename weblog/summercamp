<h1>Last Day of Summer Camp</h1>

<p>Ten calls are coming through on my cell phone at once. I try to answer them in order. Finally I get to my mom. &#8220;Just wanted to see how you are,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Oh, by the way, Alexis called the cops.&#8221; I try to treat this as nonchalantly as she is, but mean while I&#8217;m running to find my pants. I don my gray hoodie, grab my keys, lock the door behind me, and run out into the street, finally saying goodbye. I just make it &#8212; I see the cops coming in front of my door as I make it to the next block.</p>

<p>I know exactly what to do in these kinds of situations; I&#8217;ve seen it in all the movies. Turn off the wireless on the cell phone, pay for everything in cash, don&#8217;t use RFID cards, stick to sidestreets. I stick to sidestreets, but I still hear the cop sirens buzzing down all the major roads. There are major roads on every side of me.</p>

<hr />

<p>The lady across the aisle from me on the plane is pleading with the flight attendant. She holds her small dog between her legs (&#8220;oh, don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; she had explained, &#8220;he&#8217;ll stop barking once we take off&#8221;), covered in only a blanket. The attendant is down on his knees, trying to understand what she wants. He disappears and later I see the woman pouring a small bottle of alcohol into her drink.</p>

<p>Apparently this was a mistake. The woman starts screaming profanity, locking herself in the bathroom, running up and down the aisles. Finally, she&#8217;s forcibly restrained. The pilot comes on loud over the intercom, thanks us for our patience, explains that you&#8217;re not supposed to mix alcohol with certain psychoactive medications, tells us law enforcement will be meeting us at the gate.</p>

<p>Law enforcement meets us at the gate. &#8220;Please remain in your seats,&#8221; comes the pilot&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Law enforcement has taken control of the air craft. No one is permitted to move until law enforcement releases its control of the air craft.&#8221; Law enforcement relinquishes the air craft and as I exit I see the woman, with a couple policeman in front of her, asking her if she can see the fingers they&#8217;re holding up.</p>

<p>&#8220;God,&#8221; I think. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I just go through this yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>I forgot how much I hate San Francisco. The bus takes an hour to arrive, while I have to stand in the human filth of the city. For some reason they put the major bus transfer point at the same place drug dealers congregate. It&#8217;s not a very fun place to wait.</p>

<p>I finally get home and tumble into the mat that makes up my bed.</p>

<p>Next thing I remember I&#8217;m in the Moscone Center. MacWorld is over, but a few signs and people are still around. I look out a window for a bit and a guy taps me on the shoulder. &#8220;I think they&#8217;re trying to punk Paul Graham in that room,&#8221; he says, pointing. I go and see.</p>

<p>Paul Graham is indeed in that room, as is his girlfriend and my co-founders and the other Y Combinators I know and a bunch of people I don&#8217;t recognize (probably this year&#8217;s batch of Y Combinators). They start surrounding me. I begin to suspect a trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; I ask Steve. &#8220;Wait a second, you brought me here, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; Steve replies. &#8220;I mean, I remember going to sleep, I remember kind of wanting to wake up, but then all of the sudden I&#8217;m in the Moscone Center? How did I get here? You must have brought me here, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve denies all knowledge, but there&#8217;s a gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>The people surrounding me take a step closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make a deal. If I can tickle every last one of you, I go free. Otherwise, you win.&#8221;</p>

<p>They seem to accept the deal.</p>

<p>I begin tickling.</p>

<p>People begin running, dodging, flying around the room. But I&#8217;m like a heat-seeking missile. I track down every one of them, extend my hands out, go straight for their armpits.</p>

<p>I win.</p>

<hr />

<p>I wake up on my mat. The sun is shining brightly. It&#8217;s a beautiful day. I whistle a happy tune. I go to wait for the bus. One bus goes by, it&#8217;s too full to stop. Another comes by after what seems like an eternity. It&#8217;s almost as full, but I&#8217;m not going to wait for yet another. I hang from the bar overhead, just barely fitting inside. There&#8217;s no room for my feet.</p>

<p>The bus gets off a couple blocks from my office. To get there, I have to walk past the Moscone Center. That&#8217;s when it comes back to me. I look hard at the Moscone Center. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; I say. &#8220;It must have been a dream.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&#8220;Goooood Monday morning,&#8221; I say, entering my office. That&#8217;s kind of my little thing, my little ritual. &#8220;Goooood XXX morning,&#8221; I say in a happy voice, replacing the XXX with the name of the day I&#8217;m saying it on. I only say it once each day.</p>

<p>My co-worker is ignoring me.</p>

<hr />

<p>I am presented with a letter accepting my resignation. I am told to collect my &#8220;personal effects&#8221;. A woman from HR politely escorts me from the premises. She never says that she is escorting me, but she does stand behind me wherever I go. I think I am supposed to leave.</p>

<p>I leave. The sun is shining brightly. It&#8217;s a beautiful day.</p>
