<p><a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/stories/behind_the_scenes_the_minority_report_trailer.shtml">Behind the Scenes: The Minority Report Trailer</a> Who knew that making trailers could be so funny?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Quin/">The W3C&#8217;s XML Activity Lead</a> <a href="http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2002/07/12/2002-07-12.html#1026516648.408835">is giving a talk on simplifying XML</a>. Is there a problem yet?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macintoshdigitalhub.com/reviews/eyetv/">EyeTV</a> is a software PVR (like TiVo or ReplayTV) for the Mac. It looks pretty well designed (although matching the TiVo&#8217;s incredible ease-of-use would be a feat) and is probably the only way I&#8217;d ever watch TV.</p>

<p>I decided to <a href="http://www.eff.org/opportunities/">volunteer for the EFF</a> because I don&#8217;t really have enough money to effectively <a href="http://www.eff.org/support/">donate</a> even though I continually encourage others to donate. I figured that in order to stop seeming hypocritical I should volunteer myself. I strongly support the work they do on many fronts to protect our rights online. Potentially helping all the great people that work there is a plus. </p>

<p>Public Service Announcement: Dry ice is fun. Pick up some at your local ice cream parlor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/779198.asp">ISPs ask users to take copyrighted content down.</a> This is interesting. It&#8217;s certainly a lot better than shutting the networks themselves down. I wonder how people will fight back. Obviously this won&#8217;t stop the problem, but it might cause networks to start implementing <a href="http://wiki.haven.sh/index.php/PeekabootyResourceDiscovery">Peek-a-Booty-style security</a> (making searchers execute some sort of challeng difficult for machines). A web-of-trust solution (you have to be certified as cool before you download) would also be interesting.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe that <a href="http://www.cunap.com/~hardingr/projects/osx/exploit.html">Software Update on OS X had no security</a> but now that there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.info.apple.com/kbnum/n75304">a patch</a> (<a href="https://depot.info.apple.com/security7-12/">HTTPS server</a>) (also available via Software Update) I guess it must be true. It looks like the update just uses checksums which doesn&#8217;t sound very secure to me. Really, how hard is it to use digital signatures these days? OS X already comes with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macos/security.html">a ton of security stuff</a>, you&#8217;d think this wouldn&#8217;t be hard to add.</p>

<p>McCusker: &#8220;Being compared to Knuth is scary though, since he&#8217;s a god of computer science, and I&#8217;m more like a game show host.&#8221; [<a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm">cite</a>]</p>

<p>Cocoa is talking to Movable Type! <a href="http://media.org/woof.html">Woof!</a> However, I&#8217;m not sure if I should ask for a nicer Movable Type API or do more scraping. I might write my own but it would probably be in Python, which I don&#8217;t really want to require with my code and it&#8217;s unlikely I could get it included with the standard distribution. Hm.</p>
