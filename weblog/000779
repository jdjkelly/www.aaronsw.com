	<h1>what should I do with my life?</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>The &#8220;holidays&#8221; have given me some time to relax and think about what to do next. What should I do next? Things don&#8217;t seem as clear cut as they did before. Here are the things that seem interesting:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use wireless to bring back the community-run Internet</li>
<li>Write software to make non-commercial copying easier</li>
<li>Learn new subjects and read lots of books</li>
<li>Answer email (I have 3069 messages to handle) and chat on IRC</li>
</ol>

<p>1 would be the most fulfilling, but it&#8217;s extremely difficult and involves a lot of talking to people who live in California and who I&#8217;m too nervous to talk to. 2 is eminently doable, but getting users will be hard. 3 is what I&#8217;ve been doing the past few weeks; it&#8217;s enjoyable but it doesn&#8217;t seem productive. 4 is what I used to do; it&#8217;s enjoyable and productive but it didn&#8217;t seem fulfilling.</p>

<p>To some extent, I guess, I need to do all of them, but I&#8217;m very bad at balancing my time. To get 1 or 2 done, I need to throw away all my other comittments, which is difficult. To do 3 or 4, I have to mute the dreams of 1 or 2 which is painful. (I get feelings of being overworked and out-of-control.)</p>

<p>Argh, what should I do?</p>
