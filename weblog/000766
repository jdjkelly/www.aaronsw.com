<p>On Tuesday I took the <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">CalTrain</a> to Sunnyvale. (I kept hearing Californians complain (apparently seriously) about their poor public transit. Huh? The public transit there is incredible.) I took a cab to <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> and met <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/">Kevin Marks</a> for lunch. We talked about various things and he explained <a href="http://www.mediagora.com/">mediAgora</a> to me. <a href="http://www.ambiguous.org/quinn/">Quinn</a> and <a href="http://www.spesh.com/danny/">Danny</a> picked me up (an hour late) and we drove around (they&#8217;re very funny; it was a laugh a minute) and then went to an Ethiopian restaurant. <a href="http://www.jong.org/">Gilbert</a> later joined us. Then they dropped me off at <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> (an hour late &#8212; at least they&#8217;re consistent) where I met up with <a href="http://www.lisarein.com/">Lisa</a> and <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Cory</a>. I met lots of cool Google people including <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/~page/">Larry Page</a>. Then I squeezed in Lisa&#8217;s truck with her and Cory and they dropped me off at Chef Chu&#8217;s for the <a href="http://advogato.org/person/raph/diary.html?start=303">Levien</a>-<a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newDec02.htm#16dec02-dinner">McCusker</a> dinner. <a href="http://www.holoweb.net/~liam/">Liam Quin</a>, Andy Hertzfeld (<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, <a href="http://eazel.com/">Eazel</a>, <a href="http://differnet.com/">Differnet</a>, <a href="http://osafoundation.org/">OSAF</a>), <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/">Bram Cohen</a> and Drue Lowenstern (<a href="http://mojonation.net">Mojo Nation</a>, <a href="http://gigagig.org/">Gigagig</a>, <a href="http://khashmir.sf.net/">Khashmir</a>) were also there. Drue and Bram couldn&#8217;t fit into our table, so they went with David to a satellite table. (deltab wonders if the satellite table had satellite dishes.) I spent most of the dinner at the main table, but switched to the satellite table towards the end. Most of the time when I hear about an interesting party, I regret not being there. This was the first time I can recall being at the interesting party, but sitting at the wrong table! <a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newDec02.htm#21dec02-dinner">McCusker&#8217;s description</a> and comments from others make me regret not sitting at the satellite table. After dinner Drue drove us back to San Francisco, while Raph and Bram had a fascinating discussion about trust metrics and related things.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Lisa and I went to the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> to talk with the leader of the SFLAN project. (The goal is to give free wireless to all of San Francisco; <a href="http://www.kahle.org/Brewster/">Brewster Kahle</a> is willing to fund it.) They have the bandwidth and the equipment, but they need a geek to just go out and make it happen. Volunteers? Then we went to Belmont and I had lunch with <a href="http://www.kei.com/homepages/mkapor/">Mitch Kapor</a> and saw the <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">OSAF</a> offices. Then we went back to San Francisco and saw the new LOTR movie with the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> Staff. Then we went to the EFF Staff Xmas party. Then Ren (<a href="http://www.eff.org/contact.html">EFF</a>) drove some of us home and I went home with <a href="http://www.loyalty.org/~schoen/">Seth</a> and <a href="http://www.healthhacker.com/biella/">Biella</a>. Then <a href="http://crummy.com/">Leonard</a> and <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sumanah/">Sumana</a> came to Seth&#8217;s house and we talked (<a href="http://crummy.com/nb/view.cgi/nycb/2002/12/19/0">Leonard&#8217;s report and photos</a>). Seth cleaned out his room and found an extra copy of the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sshtdg/">O&#8217;Reilly SSH book</a> which he gave to me. Sumana (whose intials are SSH) and Seth (SDS &#8212; SSH without integrity checking) signed it for me. Lisa came to pick me up and take me home. I realized this morning that I left the book at Seth&#8217;s house. Oops!</p>

<p>On Thursday (today) I went home. Now the sun is setting behind a wall of clouds, making everything an eerie yellow. I wonder how life can be so much faster in San Francisco &#8212; I didn&#8217;t do anything of interest today!</p>

<p>I think I packed a lot into the trip; it was certainly a lot of fun. If the plane tickets weren&#8217;t so expensive, I would have stayed until tomorrow. I could then go see Raph&#8217;s family, <a href="http://pobox.com/~kragen/">Kragen</a> (and <a href="http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/bearing.html">fianc&eacute;</a>/<a href="http://www.murch-sitaker.org/">soon-to-be-wife</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/blmurch/">Beatrice</a>), <a href="http://lfw.org/ping/">Ka-Ping</a>, <a href="http://mnot.net/">Mark Nottingham</a>, <a href="http://www.bab5.org/">Bab5</a> (Thursday nights), and the weekly Internet Archive staff meeting (Fridays). I might also be able to see the EFF offices, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> (and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">CC</a> and <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/">CIS</a> offices), and <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a>.</p>

<p>I think San Francisco would be a fun place to live, but Cory said that it&#8217;s not usually this interesting, I&#8217;m just lucky. It seems the older people are all trying to get out of San Francisco and the younger people love it there. Cory says I&#8217;m a &#8220;punk kid&#8221; for this comment. ;-) (I&#8217;m probably overgeneralizing.)</p>
