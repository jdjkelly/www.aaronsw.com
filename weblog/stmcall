<h1>A Call for Science that Matters</h1>

<p>Ever see a study that makes you scratch your beard? Ever hear about a research result that makes you go &#8220;I wish everybody knew about this!&#8221;? Ever want to run into a congressman&#8217;s office and hit them over the head with a journal article? In this era of technological complexity and postmodern fiction, sometimes brain scans can reveal more about the human condition than a new novel. And yet, while the novels get detailed reviews in the <em>New York Times</em>, the best a research study is likely to get is an inaccurate description and some ambiguous quotes from the study&#8217;s authors.</p>

<p>Well, here&#8217;s your chance to change that. In the comments, post your favorite study &#8212; the one that makes you sit up and say &#8220;wow, this result ought to change everything&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t mind, we&#8217;ll take the best to help fill up a new website we&#8217;re starting, collecting and sharing these new research results. (If you want to help us with the project, <a href="mailto:editors@sciencethatmatters.com">be sure to let us know!</a>)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll go first:</p>

<p>In 1994, the RAND Corporation, a major US military think tank, conducted a massive study (with funding from the Office of National drug Control Policy, the US Army, and the Ford Foundation) to measure the effectiveness of various forms of preventing the use of illegal drugs, particularly cocaine.</p>

<p>They analyzed a variety of popular methods and calculated how much it would cost to use each method to reduce cocaine consumption in the US by 1%. Source-country control &#8212; military programs to destroy drug production in countries like Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia &#8212; are not just devastating to poor third-world citizens; they&#8217;re also the least effective, costing $783 million for a 1% reduction. Interdiction &#8212; seizing the drugs at the border &#8212; is a much better deal, costing only $366 million. Domestic law enforcement &#8212; arresting drug dealers and such &#8212; is even better, at $246 million. But all of those are blown completely out of the water by the final option: funding treatment programs for drug addicts would reduce drug use by 1% at a cost of only $34 million.</p>

<p>In other words, for every dollar spent on trying to stop drugs through source-country control, we could get the equivalent of twenty dollars benefit by spending the same money on treatment. This isn&#8217;t a bunch of hippy liberals saying this. This is a government think tank, sponsored by the US Army.</p>

<p>I think the study quoted in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/24/opinion/24gilbert.html?ei=5088&amp;en=d3e66404c34a3f4b&amp;ex=1311393600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">this article</a> very interesting: &#8220;The researcher began the game by exerting a fixed amount of pressure on the first volunteer’s finger. The first volunteer was then asked to exert precisely the same amount of pressure on the second volunteer’s finger. The second volunteer was then asked to exert the same amount of pressure on the first volunteer’s finger. And so on. The two volunteers took turns applying equal amounts of pressure to each other’s fingers while the researchers measured the actual amount of pressure they applied.</p>

<p>The results were striking. Although volunteers tried to respond to each other’s touches with equal force, they typically responded with about 40 percent more force than they had just experienced.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very simple test to separate out those who are incapable of abstract reasoning:</p>

<p>http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000635.html</p>

<p>If half of the students in a <em>programming</em> class are incapable of abstract reasoning (and will fail that class because of it), what does that say about the general population?</p>

<p>Prescription: people incapable of abstract reasoning need to be made into second-class citizens, with absolutely no say in any important social, political or economic decisions. Nothing to say about pollution, energy, healthcare, tax policy, war, peace, not even the political system itself. Their judgement is provably no good.</p>

<p>this is really a statement of the obvious. But basically, cities are good and the larger they are the better. The more you share key infrastructure, the more efficiently you use your resources, the more surplus you leave for people to live the good life, the more leisure they have, the more time they have to innovate.</p>

<p>We need to figure out ways to build downtowns like Paris instead of &#8220;growing&#8221; lots of tiny towns or decreasing urban density by plopping down commercial skyscrapers. Death to urban planners!</p>

<p>the obvious tradeoff, unmentioned in your summary is the numbers of source-countrys vs the number of users.   and governments tend have more structured ways of dealing w/ peers (other governments) than with citizens.  couple this with a known tendency to have plausable deniability - &#8220;its the governments job&#8221; instead of each person being indivdually responsible, is in large measure a cost driver.  imho of course.</p>

There are many researchers working on this subject. McFarland (the pediatrist) above is only one of them, dealing with only a small part of it.</p>

<p>And empathic parenting is only the tip of a very big iceberg in research about the history of childhood. Childhood in the past was horrific. And childhood in primitive cultures is horrific. This has enormous implications for foreign policy. We shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;respecting&#8221; third-world cultures. We should be breaking them using armies of social workers.</p>

Summary: <i>Half of all chemicals tested in standard high-dose animal cancer tests, whether occurring naturally or produced synthetically, are &#8220;carcinogens.&#8221; &#8230;  The focus of regulatory policy is on synthetic chemicals, although 99.9% of the chemicals humans ingest are natural&#8230;.  Plants in the human diet contain thousands of natural &#8220;pesticides&#8221; produced by plants to protect themselves from insects and other predators&#8230;.  If reducing synthetic pesticides makes fruits and vegetables more expensive, thereby decreasing consumption, then the cancer rate will increase, especially for the poor.</i></p>

Some of the cognitive bias ones were annoying because the researchers seemed oblivious that when asking people to &#8220;Rank by probability: (1) A, (2) A and B&#8221; that English is just ambiguous enough that it&#8217;s legitimate (or not, depending on precise wording) to rank (2) as more probable than (1).  Some of the other cognitive bias questions also likewise seemed &#8220;stacked.&#8221;  I wonder about the cognitive bias of people when confronted with the possibility that modern physics experiments may cause catastrophic events; for example, I&#8217;ve been wondering for some time about the Large Hadron Collider&#8217;s safety report, which uses Hawking&#8217;s (untested) theory to that argue that the world will not end when the LHC starts up.  Now six different academics authored this paper <a href="http://doc.cern.ch/yellowrep/2003/2003-001/p1.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, but one wonders about cognitive bias when one realizes that they are effectively promising that 6 billion people on our planet will not die due to the logical consequences of an untested theory.  Perhaps I misread the paper or perhaps I should contact the authors and ask for an explanation.</p>

<p>The &#8220;programmers fall into 2 categories&#8221; writeup is really informal; I think one should look for better studies in that area.</p>

<p>I guess you guys have already seen the &#8220;Magic Ink&#8221; paper by Bret Victor.  Let&#8217;s see, I&#8217;d recommend the Lifelong Kindergarten research group&#8217;s publications (MIT) <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>; for an informal document, I enjoyed &#8220;Computer as Paint Brush:
Technology, Play, and the Creative Society&#8221; by Mitchel Resnick <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/playlearn-handout.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.  The underlying values remind me in some ways of Bob Black&#8217;s Abolition of Work essay, but presented without the anarchy and pessimism.</p>

<p>Also, it looks like you&#8217;re editorializing, so maybe delete the comment by the ad hominem guy?</p>

<p>Oh, and call me superstitious, but I avoid AI research because I was once in the shower and hadn&#8217;t thought about AI-related topics for 7 months when I thought, &#8220;Hey could I use introspection to program a copy of myself?&#8221;  I wasn&#8217;t paying much attention as I flipped open a plastic shampoo bottle and somehow took a 2 cm long gouge of skin out of my thumb; the cut was quite deep.  Maybe lots of people cut themselves on plastic shampoo bottles, but it seemed really spooky to me.  This coupled with the sudden &#8220;deep thoughts&#8221; about AI gave me the really unsettling feeling that my body was disintegrating.  Not a happy feeling!  So I avoid AI.</p>

<p>That assumes the last 1% costs as much as the first 1%&#8212;ridiculous bunk.  A real study would have determined price curves for all of those methods as the percentage gets higher and higher.</p>

<p>Albert Bartlett&#8217;s talk on exponential growth and finite resources is also important, not because it is particularly unobvious or hasn&#8217;t been repeated loudly by many people, but because 99% of both the public and our leaders appear to &#8220;believe in growth&#8221; which unfortunately has the effect of clearly contradicting physics, even within our lifetime.

<p>From the Overcoming Bias web site (http://www.overcomingbias.com/) a pointer to another RAND study that &#8220;changes everything&#8221;; this time w.r.t. health care spending.  They put it clearly and succinctly (http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/medicine_as_sca.html), but the gist is that there is no correlation between health care spending and outcomes.</p>

<p>Impressive article. I reallly like and share your ideas. I think the contributors are much more important. Articles should&#8217;t be deleted because of format, I wouldnt call it a good idea. IMHO it is unfair for contributors it seems to spoil esoteric character of Wikipedia as the palce that unites people under the flag of sharing information. Wikeipedia is one of those places that make information free an accessible. Format shouldnt be improtnat this what seems to be esenctial - is content. Best regards</p>

<p>Actually, I now think I&#8217;d change my post for &#8220;science that matters&#8221; to the attempts by Aubrey de Grey to introduce the public to the potential feasibility of life extension research.  If one is being strictly rational, it probably makes sense to throw billions of dollars at researching life extension on humans and species similar to us.  Most people are strictly irrational when dealing with the &#8220;ethical issues&#8221; of letting people live longer, thus the pressing need to popularize life extension research.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey</p>
