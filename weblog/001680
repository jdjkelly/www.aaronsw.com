<div class="content">
<p class="dateline">Stanford, California &#8212; April 12</p>

<p>I finally get to the class I&#8217;ve been missing lately, only to find I haven&#8217;t been missing much. We&#8217;re learning about stem-and-leaves plots, which I learned about in the 7th grade, and it wasn&#8217;t interesting then. </p>

<p>But perhaps it&#8217;s not the professor&#8217;s fault &#8212; maybe it&#8217;s the sports jersey he&#8217;s wearing. In addition to not being particularly educational, he jogs around the room lifts chalkboards up and down and up and down, and grabs swigs from a sports waterbottle while on the go.</p>

<p class="dateline">April 13</p>

<p>I have taken two IHUM (Introduction to the HUManities) courses. The first was a right-wing course in which the TF told us &#8216;You might think you found an error in Locke&#8217;s logic, but you should check again, because Locke was a pretty smart guy.&#8217;, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001518">got mad with me for talking about Vietnam</a>, and suggested I drop out of school. The message of the course, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001516">I concluded</a>, was &#8216;the world is just fine, so we shouldn&#8217;t do anything, and even if we did, it would just make things worse.&#8217;</p>

<p>The new IHUM is a left-wing course in which the TF asks us &#8216;Do you agree with Marx? Where was he wrong?&#8217; and got mad at me for abusing my white male blogger knowledge power to silence the rest of the class, and suggested I go to a progressive/radical school. The message of the course, I conclude, is &#8216;the world is a terrible mess, but is so rotten that we can&#8217;t do anything, except maybe by purchasing more &#8220;socially-responsible&#8221; items&#8217;. (Madison Avenue is apparently the new Marx &#8212; overthrow capitalism through&#8230;more capitalism! (This theme is thoroughly documented in Thomas Frank&#8217;s early work.))</p>

<p class="dateline">April 14</p>

<p>My grandfather was a capitalist. My father was a capitalist. I went to elementary school and junior high in the sixth-richest city in America. I went to high school in the third-richest. Yet somehow I failed to notice all this. (Perhaps because I lived way down in the 47th-richest city.)<a href="http://wealth.mongabay.com/tables/100_income_zip_codes-10000.html">†</a> [^fn1]</p>

<p>But between IHUM and social stratification, I&#8217;ve had much occasion to think about class lately. In social stratification, for example, we read a study of how different classes raise their children differently. The middle class engages in a process of &#8220;concerted cultivation&#8221; &#8212; lots of questions from parents, constant planned activities with same-aged peers, encouraging them to ask questions of authority figures &#8212; which instill a sense of entitlement, an inability to manage one&#8217;s own leisure time, an ability to easily make friends with same-age peers, and a taste for competition.</p>

<p>Working class parents, by contrast, engage in what&#8217;s termed &#8220;natural development&#8221; &#8212; letting kids play on their own, not asking them many questions, encouraging them to hide from and lie to authority figures &#8212; which instills a sense of constraint in the face of power, teaches them to manage their own free time, and has them hang out mostly with family members.</p>

<p>From this I can only conclude that my parents screwed up or something, because I have the opposite of all the middle class features: I&#8217;m afraid of asking for things from people, even the tech support guy on the phone; I&#8217;m excellent at managing m own free time, and thus distasteful of structured activities; I have trouble making friends with people my own age; and I hate competition.</p>

<p>As I exit the class, I come up with an obscure Marxist joke about this &#8212; perhaps my parents&#8217; contradictory class location caused a contradictory class cultivation &#8212; before a boy on a bicycle stops me. &#8216;Are you Aaron Swartz?&#8217; he asks. &#8216;Yeah,&#8217; I say. &#8216;Oh, hi!&#8217; he says. &#8220;Mark Granovetter speaks very highly of you.&#8221; <em>Mark Granovetter?</em> I think. I thought I was the one speaking highly of <em>him</em>! After hanging around people who wrote odes to the Granovetter diagram and playing with computer languages which centered around the Granovetter operator, I was amazed to find the man actually exists and furthermore, heads the department in which I&#8217;m studying. But that he knows that I exist? That&#8217;s too much to handle. The bicycle boy recommends I take Granovetter&#8217;s class. &#8216;It&#8217;s really fun; you&#8217;d love it.&#8217; Maybe I will.</p>

<p>[^fn1]: Just from more looking at that chart: for fun we&#8217;d visit #39, my friend lived in #45, we&#8217;d go to the mall at #68 and #77, and the people we thought of as poor lived in #83. We had quite the racket going; I had no idea.</p>

<hr />

<p>There&#8217;s something magical about a band having fun. In certain recordings of the String Cheese Incident, for example, you can almost feel the smiles of the band members through their music and can&#8217;t help but smile yourselves. The Stanford band is performing on a piece of grass outside and their enthusiasm is similarly infections. Even walking behind them, without even being able to see them (a wall is in the way), I can&#8217;t help but break out in a grin, it&#8217;s so obvious they&#8217;re having fun. Instruments are surprisingly expressive.</p>

<p>Aaron, why don&#8217;t you use E-Prime? </p>

<p>&#8220;E-Prime, short for English Prime, is a modification of the English language that prohibits the use of the verb &#8216;to be&#8217;. The term was coined by Dr. David Bourland in the 1965 work A Linguistic Note: Writing in E-Prime. E-Prime arose from Alfred Korzybski&#8217;s General Semantics and his observation that English speakers most often use &#8216;to be&#8217; to express dogmatic beliefs or assumptions or to avoid expressing opinions and feelings as such.&#8221;</p>

<p>Because E-Prime can be used to express the fact that E-Prime sucks? :-)</p>

<p>Or, how about something more rigorous: I can use E-Prime to express the fact that E-Prime sucks.</p>

<p>Or in short&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;E-Prime sucks.</p>
