<p>[The above number is the Xing DeCSS key, in decimal.]</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s Crypto-Gram has a real zinger about the DigiVigilante biill, <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0208.html#5">License to Hack</a>.</p><blockquote>Counterattack is wrong, both legally and morally. Vigilante justice is wrong, both legally and morally. Victims of attack are allowed to defend themselves, but they&#8217;re not allowed to take the law into their own hands and attack back. That&#8217;s why we have police. None of this is new or controversial, so why are copyright holders even talking about this? [&#8230;]</p>

<p>To me, it&#8217;s another example of the insane lengths the entertainment companies are willing to go to preserve their business models. They&#8217;re willing to destroy your privacy, have general-purpose computers declared illegal, and exercise special vigilante police powers that no one else has&#8230;just to make sure that no one watches &#8220;The Little Mermaid&#8221; without paying for it. They&#8217;re trying to invent a new crime: interference with a business model.</p>

<p>Sad, really.</blockquote><p>In the same issue he also <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0208.html#1">brings up some non-technical points about Palladium</a> and includes this quip from a reader:</p><blockquote>I think the name says it all.  It was sent from the gods; no man may look at it, lest they be blinded (probably a reference to the open source movement and reverse engineering lawsuits).  It was supposed to protect Troy, but it doesn&#8217;t protect against attacks by Trojan horses.  And, if you look at it from a commodities perspective, it may be more expensive than gold&#8230;</blockquote><p>Is it poisonous too?</p>
