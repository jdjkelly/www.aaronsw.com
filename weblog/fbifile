<h1>Wanted by the FBI</h1>

<p>I got my FBI file today. (<a href="http://foia.fbi.gov/privacy_instruc.htm">Request yours!</a>) As I hoped, it&#8217;s truly delightful. It has only minor redactions for reasons of personal privacy (basically, they deleted agents&#8217; names and so on). It all started when the&#8212;actually, I&#8217;ll let the file tell the story:</p>

<p>February 6, from Washington Field to Chicago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UNCLASSIFIED</p>
  
  <p>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIoN</p>
  
  <p><strong>Precedence:</strong> ROUTINE</p>
  
  <p><strong>Case ID #:</strong> 288A-WF-238343 (Pending)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Title:</strong> UNSUB(s);
  US COURTS - VICTIM;
  COMPUTER INTRUSION - OTHER</p>
  
  <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> To set lead to locate Aaron Swartz.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Enclosure(s):</strong> Attached is an Accurint Report for Swartz.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Details:</strong> The U.S. Courts implemented a pilot project offering free access to federal court records through the PACER system at seventeen federal depository libraries. Library personnel maintain login and password security and provide access to users from computers within the library. PACER normally carries an eight cents per page fee, however, by accessing from one of the seventeen libraries, users may search and download data for free.</p>
  
  <p>Between September 4, 2008 and September 22, 2008, PACER was accessed by computers from outside the library utilizing login information from two libraries participating in the pilot project. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts reported that the PACER system was being inundated with requests. One request was being made every three seconds.</p>
  
  <p>[&#8230;] The two accounts were responsible for downloading more than eighteen million pages with an approximate value of $1.5 million.</p>
  
  <p>[&#8230;] Data that was exfiltrated went to one of two Amazon IP addresses.</p>
  
  <p>Investigation has determined that the Amazon IP address used to access the PACER system belongs to Aaron Swartz.</p>
  
  <p>The following information was provided for the IP address:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Name: Aaron Swartz<br />
    Address: 349 Marshman Avenue, Highland Park, IL 60035<br />
    Telephone: 847-432-8857</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>A search in Accurint and Swartz&#8217;s personal webpage confirmed this information. Swartz&#8217;s social security account number is [&#8230;]. The telephone subscriber for telephone number [REDACTED] is [REDACTED].</p>
  
  <p>NCIS report for Aaron Swartz was negative. A search for wages for Swartz at the Department of Labor was negative.</p>
  
  <p>[&#8230;]</p>
  
  <p>Washington Field Office requests that the North RA attempt to locate AARON SWARTZ, his vehicles, drivers license information and picture, and others, at 349 Marshman Avenue, Highland Park, IL 60035. Since SWARTZ is the potential subject of an ongoing investigation, it is requested that SWARTZ not be approached by agents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Lead covered by Chicago North RA</p>
  
  <p><strong>Enclosure(s):</strong> Illinois DL/ID Image of Swartz and Accurint Vehicle/Residence Reports for Swartz address.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Details:</strong> Attempted to locate AARON SWARTZ, his vehicles, drivers license information and picture, and others at 349 Marshman Avenue, Highland Park, IL 60035.</p>
  
  <p>Successfully located drivers license photo for SWARTZ. Drove by address in an attempt to locate SWARTZ or vehicles related to the residence, but was unsuccessful. House is set on a deep lot, behind other houses on Marshman Avenue. This is a heavily wooded, dead-end street, with no other cars parked on the road making continued surveillance difficult to conduct without severely increasing the risk of discovery. However, divers license and Accurint information lists address above. Other family members are listed as current residents and four vehicles are currently registered to Susan Swartz who resides at above address. Illinois database checks for SWARTZ yielded negative results. SWARTZ has no arrests, no registered vehicles or property.</p>
  
  <p>Chicago considers this lead covered.</p>

  <p>[REDACTED] provided the following information:</p>
  
  <p>AARON SWARTZ would have known his access was unauthorized because it was with a password that did not belonged to him.</p>

  <p>SA [REACTED] spoke to SWARTZ, at telephone number [&#8230;], and explained that the FBI is looking for information on how SWARTZ was able to compromise the PACER system so that the US COURTS could implement repairs to the system and get PACER running again.

<p>&#8220;PACER system was being inundated with requests. One request was being made every three seconds.&#8221;</p>

<p>I got a good laugh out of that one. I guess they weren&#8217;t expecting much of a user base for the system.</p>

<p>From the FBI FOIA request site:
&#8220;If your request is for information concerning an organization, business, investigation, historical event, or incident, you may submit your request online&#8221;.
FBI link: http://foia.fbi.gov/foia_request.htm</p>

<p>I thought it might be interesting to send a request for &#8220;Wired&#8221; but I vainly tried filling out the online form with both Firefox and IE8.  Maybe it&#8217;s just me.  I&#8217;m probably lacking the &#8220;critical skills&#8221; that the FBI agents possess.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really understand the need to undergo the pacer project. It&#8217;s a trivial expense not exactly designed to source of government profit.. why would they make the records publicly available at libraries. I have a pacer account and I can tell you the info you get from it is pretty dull and not at all hidden from the public. I&#8217;m sure you could have made pacer available for free if you just wrote your congressman rather than accessing the open terminals the way you did.</p>

<p>No, it wasn&#8217;t your fault &#8212; the FBI &#8220;online entry form&#8221; at &#8220;http://foia.fbi.gov/foia_request.htm&#8221; is a fake page.</p>

<p>It has a &#8220;SEND&#8221; button at the bottom, but if you look at the HTML, there&#8217;s nothing to fill out &#8212; the underlined areas are just that; text underlines.  There&#8217;s no fields to fill out.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t know if this is just a really bad joke or a really, really bad web programmer. :\</p>

<p>Wow, reads like a Stasi (East German Ministry for State Security) report. Well, the term &#8220;Homeland Security&#8221; isn&#8217;t that much different to &#8220;State Security&#8221; anyway, props to Dubya that the US got an org like the East German one, it was sorely lacking.</p>

<p>Wow! The article does now say if, or how much, it costs to request one&#8217;s file from the FBI. I know I&#8217;ve got one, because the Director of the FBI once had me picked up and taken for a ride in Seattle. I had predicted that the Unabomber would turn out to be a mathematician, based on my linguistic analysis of the Unabomber Manifesto. Anyway, it is very noble to write a Perl script and put $1.5M worth of court documents up on the Amazon cloud. Makes we want to learn Perl to do artificial intelligence. Good-bye for now and good luck foerever!</p>
