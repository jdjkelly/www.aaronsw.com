	<h1>Blogshine Sunday: US Greenlights, Funds Genocide</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>Today, news organizations across the country have decided to honor a <a href="http://www.sunshineweek.org/">&#8220;Sunshine Sunday&#8221;</a> by running stories &#8220;in support of public access to government information&#8221;. The student activist group <a href="http://freeculture.org/">FreeCulture.org</a> is running a concurrent <a href="http://blogshine.org/">&#8220;Blogshine Sunday&#8221;</a> to preserve the rights of all citizens to government information.</p>

<p>The difference is no minor quibble. Government documents, while formally released, are widely ignored by the &#8220;intellectual culture&#8221;, including the media. To truly honor Blogshine Sunday, I&#8217;ve chosen to take a look at a classified document posted online by the <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/">National Security Archive</a>, an invaluable service.</p>

<p>The page is <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB62/">East Timor Revisited</a>. To prove my point about these documents being ignored, I did a Lexis-Nexis search of major papers (keyword:&#8221;east timor&#8221; AND kissinger). Two US papers covered it: the San Diego Union-Tribune (carrying a 717 Reuters story) and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A5291-2001Dec6&amp;notFound=true">a piece buried on page A38 of the <em>Washington Post</em></a>, there only through the efforts of the invaluable Dana Milbank.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the story: East Timor was a Portuguese colony. In 1975 there was a short civil war between the moderate Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) and the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin), Fretilin quickly won, pushing out both the UDT and the Portuguese rulers. Indonesia, which had no claim to the country, responded by secretly infiltrating it and trying to provoke clashes. Among other things, they killed five Australian television journalists. When this was ineffective, they started building up for a full scale invasion.</p>

<p>It is against this background that in December, US President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger stopped by in Indonesia to meet with President Suharto. The transcript, published by the National Security Archive, shows us what happened.</p>

<p>Suharto explains &#8220;Fretilin has declared its independence unilaterally &#8230; Portugal, however, is unable to control the situation. If this continues it will &#8230; increase the instability in the area. &#8230; It is now important to determine what we can do to establish peace and order or the present and the future in the interest of the security of the area and Indonesia. These are some of the considerations we are now contemplating, we want your understanding if we deem it necessary to take rapid or drastic action.&#8221; </p>

<p>Ford replies, &#8220;We will understand and will not press you on the issue. We understand the problem you have and the intentions you have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kissinger adds, clearly understanding what &#8220;drastic action&#8221; means, &#8220;You appreciate that the use of US-made arms could create problems. &#8230; It is important that whatever you do succeeds quickly. We would be able to influence the reaction in America if whatever happens happens after we return. This way there would be less chance of people talking in an unauthorized way. &#8230; Whatever you do, however, we will try to handle in the best way possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indonesia invaded with its &#8220;US-made arms&#8221; the next day. And Kissinger was quite effect at keeping people from &#8220;talking in an unauthorized way&#8221; &#8212; the press barely covered the incident.</p>

<p>When Kissinger was later asked about the meeting and its timing, he lied, saying that &#8216;Timor was never discussed with us when we were in Indonesia&#8221;, they were just &#8220;told at the airport as we left Jakarta that either that day or the next day they intended to take East Timor.&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;nobody asked our opinion, and I don&#8217;t know what we could have said if someone had asked our opinion. It was literally told to us as we were leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the end of the month, 20,000 Indonesia troops were deployed to the region. Its estimated that 100,00 Timorese were killed in the first year, perhaps even 230,000 total (this in a country of only half a million), with half the population taken from their homes and moved into Indonesian camps.</p>

<p>The UN tried to intervene, but as the US ambassador, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, wrote in his memoirs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the United States wished things to turn out as they did, and worked to bring this about. The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with not inconsiderable success. <a href="http://zpedia.org/Prove_utterly_ineffective">†</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incidentally, Moynihan was clearly aware of the consequences of inaction: he writes that 60,000 had been killed.</p>

<p>So there you go &#8212; &#8220;US greenlights, funds genocide&#8221;. The media, naturally, ignores it.</p>

<p>National Security Archives has some interesting material on Iraq as well. In short, Reagan dispatched Rumsfeld to Iraq to express the president&#8217;s full support for Saddam, and to try to get him to consider building an oil pipeline through Jordon.</p>

<p>This was done, even though the US already knew that Hussein was gassing Iranians with prohibited chemical weapons. The topic never came up with Saddam, but was discussed with his subordinates.</p>

<p>State and Defense reaction to the gassing? Dead Iranians by a bullet or illegal gas, both good - they could care less, and simply wanted the issue to be kept as quiet as possible as their biggest concern was not the use of prohibited chemical weapons, but the public pressure which would get in the way of another pet project they were operating - direct shipments of nuclear materials to Saddam&#8217;s / Iraq&#8217;s &#8220;nuclear establishments&#8221;.</p>

<p>The US was already shipping said materials to other addresses in Iraq, knowing full well that they&#8217;d be transhiped to said &#8220;nuclear establishments&#8221; - they just wanted to sidestep the middleman for some reason but were concerned about congressional oversight.</p>

<p>The National Security Archive is an amazing resource and should be made required reading for all American voters. Perhaps then an &#8220;informed&#8221; choice could be made, although as one digs deep it quickly becomes obvious that doing the wrong thing comes equally naturally to both republican and democratic administrations.</p>

<p>Its even better than that, there&#8217;s some delicious irony.  Jimmy Carter sold weapons to Indonesia during some of the fiercest slaughter.  Ford at least has the excuse that they were hoping to get it over quickly.  Carter of course must have been aware of what was going on there yet continued to send them weapons, as did all subsequent presidents.  However, he is the only one that had the temerity to show up as an election monitor after East Timor&#8217;s independence.  </p>

<p>The only reporter that bothered to ask him about this was Amy Goodman from <a href="http://democracynow.org/">Democracy Now!</a>.  She just happened to be one of the reporters that witnessed a <a href="http://www.etan.org/timor/SntaCRUZ.htm">1991 massacre</a> of 250 East Timorese at a funeral, during which she was beaten and her colleague Allan Nairn had his skull fractured.</p>

<p>The notion of &#8220;required reading for all voters&#8221; is the antithesis of democracy.  You have to right to decide who is &#8220;informed enough&#8221; and who is not.  It would be no more fair to require everyone to read the Bible, or Dianetics, or What Color Is My Parachute?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see any real point in raising awareness about particular events like this.  A better goal would be to educate people as to the fact that politicians and government can never be <em>trusted</em>, that one must either maintain vigilence or accept things happening that they don&#8217;t agree with.  Fuming over specific instances in history won&#8217;t prevent them in the future.</p>

<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s no point in knowing history or the truth of specific events. And I&#8217;ve got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.</p>

<p><i>A better goal would be to educate people as to the fact that politicians and government can never be trusted,</i></p>

<p>Oh yeah, that&#8217;s a far better solution - incite apathy and ignorance by implying that nothing is true, and there is nothing that can be done about it.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to encourage people to learn the truth, and support people who tell the truth? By saying that no-one can be trusted, it says that nothing can be done.</p>

<p>In fact, there have been politicans in history who have been mostly honest and trustworthy. If you say that none can be trusted, or that they are all lying, then where is the incentive for politicians to be trustworthy or honest in the first place? They may as well lie.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I think pure democracy is a bad idea. :-) Besides, of course, requiring one to read the Bible without simultaneously requiring one to read the Skeptic&#8217;s Annotated Bible &#8212; that isn&#8217;t &#8220;informing&#8221;, that&#8217;s just bigotry.</p>

<p><i>He didn’t say no one could be trusted, he said politicians can’t be trusted. That’s true and it’s important to understand if you want to fix things.</i></p>

<p>Of course it&#8217;s true if you consider it an absurd case of &#8220;trusting politicians&#8221; as a whole. You should give trust to individuals, not categories of individuals.</p>

<p>Politicians are people, like you and me. Are people capable of being trustworthy? If so, then why can&#8217;t a person who is a politician also be trustworthy?</p>

<p><i>Where are these honest and trustworthy politicians you speak of?</i></p>

<p>Well, Bob Brown, leader of the Australian greens is a good example. i would also say that Jenny Macklin and Barry Jones are also very forthright and informed, and have not done anything untrustworthy, to my knowledge. Even Gough Whitlam&#8217;s actions tipped him onto the side of trustworthiness rather than untrustworthiness. Although you probably wouldn&#8217;t know of these people.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about the details of US politicians, but have people like Thomas Jefferson done anything to deserve distrust? Making mistakes is not the same as being untrustworthy - everyone makes mistakes. Gandhi was a good person, although I don&#8217;t know anough about him to know if he ever betrayed the trust of his people.</p>

<p>If no politicians can be trusted, then doesn&#8217;t that mean we shouldn&#8217;t have a government? Is that what you are saying?</p>

<p><i>The incentives for a politician to lie, especially when the population trusts them, are way too powerful to easily overcome.</i></p>

<p>So remove those incentives. Some politicians are strong enough to overcome them - but unfortunately, they usually don&#8217;t succeed because of smear campaigns against them by crooked politicians and media.</p>

<p>Because politicians are funded on the basis of their dishonesty. I mean, an honest person can say he&#8217;s a politician and try running for something (I&#8217;m sure many do) but, in the US at least, you&#8217;re not going to win any significant post without funding and media coverage and you&#8217;re not going to get that if you&#8217;re telling the truth.</p>

<p>I like Thomas Jefferson, but he may be the exception that proves the rule &#8212; although there&#8217;s probably some dirt you can dig up regarding the Louisiana Purchase. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am an anarchist, yes. As the saying goes,  &#8220;I think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority, hierarchy, and domination in every aspect of life, and to challenge them. Unless a justification for them can be given, they are illegitimate, and should be dismantled, to increase the scope of human freedom.&#8221; Certainly anarchists have admitted there might be need for a bureaucracy of sorts, but they&#8217;ve designed some in ways that ensure they remain bottom-up and democratic.</p>

<p>But yeah, it does seem like the pattern of history that people with power assume they&#8217;re in power because they&#8217;re better than normal people, from that they conclude that they are right and if the people disagree the people are wrong, from that they decide they better keep the truth from the people, and so they lie.</p>

<p>This is sort of at the core of our government. As James Madison said, government is set up to protect the &#8220;minority of the opulent&#8221;<a href="http://zpedia.org/Minority_of_the_opulent">†</a> from the majority &#8220;who secretly sigh for a more equal distribution of life&#8217;s blessings&#8221;<a href="http://zpedia.org/Secretly_sigh">†</a>. </p>

<p>Not sure if it&#8217;s wise to enter into a debate about the pros and cons of anarchism, but as Mike Huben <a href="http://world.std.com/~mhuben/onelesson.html">said</a>, &#8220;Government is like fire, a dangerous servant and a fearsome master. Therefore, we should avoid it entirely, as we do all forms of combustion.&#8221;</p>

<p>But back to something important that nsa said: is there any point in knowing about the bad things the US did in your grandfather&#8217;s time? I think knowing about it is one thing. What&#8217;s more important is to think about why these things happened from a supposedly free country, and how to prevent these things from happening in the future. People who ignore history &#8212; even people who say &#8220;oh, those things happened so long ago, they&#8217;re irrelevant now&#8221; &#8212; are most likely to repeat it.</p>

<p><i>Because politicians are funded on the basis of their dishonesty.</i></p>

<p>ALL politicians? You mean, it&#8217;s impossible for this not to happen, anywhere in the world?</p>

<p><i> I mean, an honest person can say he’s a politician and try running for something (I’m sure many do)</i></p>

<p>Do you consider yourself trustworthy? If you decided to become a politician, would that make you suddenly untrustworthy?</p>

<p><i>you’re not going to win any significant post without funding and media coverage and you’re not going to get that if you’re telling the truth.</i></p>

<p>Lacking funding does not make you a not-politician, or not trustworthy, just a politician who is not funded.</p>

<p>And why couldn&#8217;t there be ways to fund politicians without having to indulge lies?</p>

<p><i>I like Thomas Jefferson, but he may be the exception that proves the rule</i></p>

<p>If he&#8217;s an exception, how does he prove the rule? If he was trustworthy, then logically not all politicians are untrustworthy.</p>

<p><i>I am an anarchist, yes. As the saying goes, “I think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority, hierarchy, and domination in every aspect of life, and to challenge them.</i></p>

<p>Are you serious about that? You oppose all government, and all rule of law? If that&#8217;s the case, then why do you so often speak out in a liberal way against discrimination and whatnot?</p>

<p>If you are an anarchist, how can you support a group called &#8220;The Roosevelt Foundation&#8221; - named after someone famous for government intervention and social engineering?</p>

<p><i>This is sort of at the core of our government. As James Madison said, government is set up to protect the “minority of the opulent”† from the majority “who secretly sigh for a more equal distribution of life’s blessings</i></p>

<p>Social processes aren&#8217;t monolithic &#8212; statements about large phenomena &#8212; any phenomena, really &#8212; obviously aren&#8217;t 100%. If I was trustworthy and I decided to become a politician then yes, you shouldn&#8217;t trust me anymore. Not because being an honest politician is impossible, just because it&#8217;s extremely unlikely, and it&#8217;s only reasonable to believe the most likely thing. (If other information comes up to make it more likely that I&#8217;m the rare honest politician, then obviously you should believe that.)</p>

<p>I think you misunderstand what anarchism is about. An anarchist opposes all forms of domination. The most important one for our society is not government, but capitalism and business. (I think government is typically seen as a side-effect of capitalism.) Anarchists usually support &#8220;government intervention&#8221; and &#8220;social engineering&#8221; in the economy because it&#8217;s one step closer to democracy and because it will create greater equality and less capitalism. Similarly, anarchists oppose discrimination, because it&#8217;s just another form of power. Anarchism, in this sense, is almost sort of just the logical consequence of being an honest and intelligent liberal. </p>
