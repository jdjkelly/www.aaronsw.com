<h1>A Better Travel Guide for Geeks</h1>

<p>Pretty much anywhere you go, you can find some pretty scenery, a charming hotel, some decent restaurants, a couple of interesting museums. And the goal of most travel guides seems to be to tell you about these things. The result is a rather boring sort of tourism in which everywhere feels pretty much like everywhere else.</p>

<p>What I want is a travel guide that highlights the things that are absolutely different about this place than anywhere else you might go &#8212; the things you can&#8217;t see anywhere else. For my hometown of Cambridge, it might be the window displays on Main St. that explain how to sequence DNA, or the architectural marvels of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/stata.html">Stata</a>, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/bcs.html">BCS</a>, and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/simmons.html">Simmons</a>. In Boston, maybe it&#8217;s the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Boston_Athen%C3%A6um">Athenæum</a> or the <a href="https://twitpic.com/3djvad"><em>Globe</em> factory tour</a>. In West Virginia, maybe it&#8217;s going to see mountaintop removal or some back-to-the-land communes.</p>

<p>And maybe the right thing to do is to head somewhere else. Normal guidebooks are separated out by city and state, so if the coolest thing in Boston is actually to commute up to Providence, you&#8217;d never hear about it. But you&#8217;d put this guidebook on the Internet, so you&#8217;d give it your location and it&#8217;d tell you what was awesome nearby no matter what political jurisdiction it happened to be in.</p>

<p>Anyone know anything like that?</p>

<p>A website I built (years ago, using web.py) - http://traveldk.com/ - gives users the tools to build custom travel guides. Maybe that would be a good place to start? I can contribute some info for the UK and Palestine.</p>

<p>I would ask on http://travel.stackexchange.com (kinda StackOverflow for travelers).</p>

<p>Not the guides, but again, you can ask people there about the guides.</p>
