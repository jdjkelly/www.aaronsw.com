	<h1>Stanford: A Wired Rave</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p class="dateline">February 22</p>

<p>Thanks to my association with the Creative Commons (a gift that amazingly keeps on giving) I am invited to the cocktail party celebrating the Wired Rave Awards. My friend Chris and I head out there on Caltrain. There are quite a few cool nominees, although few appear to attend, but amazingly a few people recognize me and I get the pleasure of explaining who they are to Chris. We apparently missed seeing Lessig. Also missed: Blake Ross, who was nominated twice but lost both to Halo 2 and Howard Stern, respectively. Losing to Howard Stern! You almost feel sorry for the guy.</p>

<p>I feel like I should do more networking or something, but what&#8217;s the point? Trying to scream inane chit-chat over incredibly loud music just really isn&#8217;t that fun. And I&#8217;m looking for less fame and responsibilities, not more. Still, you feel lame just standing around in a crowd of what&#8217;s presumably the elite. Although Chris says they better not be the elite; they seem pretty uninteresting to him. Do you really want to join the cocktail parties of the high society?</p>

<p>mjd <a href="http://perl.plover.com/qrpff/">famously said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Wired</em> magazine recently asked me to write a short article explaining how [a Perl program] worked. <em>Wired</em> being what it is, I knew that no matter how little informative content I actually included, it would be too much&#8212;-they would assiduously remove all actual information from my article, and the result would be a piece which would give the reader a warm fealing of having understood, but without actually imparting anything else of value. That&#8217;s what <em>Wired</em> is about: The illusion of knowledge without any of the difficult bits. Sure enough, that is what happened. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So perhaps it&#8217;s not surprising that a <em>Wired</em> party would be aimed at much the same audience: people who want the illusion of hanging out with the hackers whose minds power Silicon Valley, without having to subject themselves to their distasteful odors. The only real hacker I saw at the party was Bram Cohen (BitTorrent) and he was probably only invited because he was nominated last year.</p>

<p>So most of the time Chris and I just sort of walk around and try to talk over the loud music. Eventually, Danger Mouse (<em>The Grey Album</em>) performs live and then the stage clears and the lights go dark as The Polyphonic Spree enters in their resplendent costumed glory. They&#8217;re really quite an amazing band; Chris and I marvel at just how much fun they seem to be having and my face lights up when I just jump up and down in the air with them. They even have a theremin player. It&#8217;s really wonderful. Chris says it&#8217;s way more fun than any normal concert. I want to run out and buy their CD.</p>
