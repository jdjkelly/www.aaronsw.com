<h1>Comment Policy</h1>

<p>I provide comments on my website to make it easier for people to provide feedback to me and to provide alternate views and clarifications to my readers.I've found that editing and deleting comments helps me best serve these goals.</p>

<p>When editing comments, I try to cut out portions which are extraneous, irrelevant, or offensive. Sometimes I will combine or reorder comments for clarity. But I will not put words in your mouth. Omissions and additions will always be noted and surrounded with [square brackets].</p>

<p>Sometimes, I will delete a comment entirely. I don't mean to stifle opposing viewpoints, only to best serve my readers's time. I enjoy and will usually include well-reasoned viewpoints that disagree with me. But it is important to remember that this is my website and I decide what I will feature. Commenting here is a privilege, not a right. There are many other sites on the Internet where you can express your viewpoint. I do not owe you space on mine.</p>
