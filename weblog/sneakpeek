<h1>Sneak Peek</h1>

<p>VOICEOVER: <em>Aaron Swartz: The Stanford Diaries</em> will return in September. Here&#8217;s a sneak preview of what to expect next season.</p>

<p>KIEFER SUTHERLAND appears in a completely black room.</p>

<p>KIEFER: Hi, I&#8217;m Kiefer Sutherland. You might know me better as Aaron Swartz in <em>Aaron Swartz: The Stanford Diaries</em>. (beat) It&#8217;s been an exciting year, culminating in a jam-packed season finale. But that&#8217;s not all there is to the story. Next year, I again play Aaron Swartz in <em>Aaron Swartz: The Stanford Diaries</em>, but this time there&#8217;s a whole lot more to the story.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AARON SWARTZ and UNSEEN TEACHER meet in a parking garage. Teacher stays in the shadows, face never revealed, although he or she is clearly wearing a trenchcoat.</p>
  
  <p>AARON: Oh, hey. I just wanted to tell you I read that book you recommended.</p>
  
  <p>TEACHER: Oh, good!</p>
  
  <p>AARON: Well, I guess I&#8217;ll see you next year.</p>
  
  <p>As Aaron turns to head away the teacher GRABS him by the arm.</p>
  
  <p>TEACHER: Wait, there&#8217;s something I need to tell you.</p>
  
  <p>AARON: Oh?</p>
  
  <p>TEACHER: I read your last paper, Aaron. That wasn&#8217;t appropriate.</p>
  
  <p>AARON: What do you mean?</p>
  
  <p>TEACHER: I think you know what I mean.</p>
  
  <p>AARON: The assignment was to write about sex, the body, or reproduction. I wrote about sex.</p>
  
  <p>TEACHER: Well, in the context of what you said to me, I had to take it to the sexual harrassment center. We just had a consult about it and it&#8217;s going in your file, but they&#8217;re not opening an investigation on you or anything. I&#8217;m sure you didn&#8217;t mean it as harrassment but I had to take it to them just to be safe.</p>
  
  <p>AARON: Oh. OK.</p>
  
  <p>TEACHER: I didn&#8217;t really have a choice, Aaron, given what you said. Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re not in trouble or anything.</p>
  
  <p>AARON: I said OK. Is there anything more you can tell me?</p>
  
  <p>TEACHER: Well, it&#8217;s confidential.</p>
  
  <p>AARON: But it&#8217;s about me! I waive my confidentiality rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>KIEFER: Was the sexual harrassment claim responsible for the meeting with [unnamed authority figure]? Will this &#8220;file&#8221; open on Aaron cause later misunderstandings to be seen in a negative light, causing Aaron to be suspended or even expelled for the things he said, forcing him to turn around and hire the right-wing Foundation for Individual Rights in Education to sue Stanford University under California&#8217;s Leonard Law which extends First Amendment protection to private universities? Who knows? I just read the scripts they give me.</p>

<p>The actual AARON SWARTZ marches out in front of Kiefer.</p>

<p>AARON: OK, that&#8217;s enough. Hi, I&#8217;m Aaron Swartz, author of <em>Aaron Swartz: The Stanford Diaries</em>. Despite the 24 season finale and Deep Throat references I&#8217;ve chosen to use in this post, I&#8217;d just like to let folks out there know that this meeting actually did happen, although not in a parking garage.</p>

<p>KIEFER: Are we done here because, uh, I&#8217;ve got some people in my trunk I need to take care of.</p>

<p>AARON: Yeah, let me give you a  hand with that.</p>

<p>Kiefer and Aaron walk off into the SUNSET that has just appeared in their solid black room.</p>
