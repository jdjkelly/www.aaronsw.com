<h1>Happy New Year</h1>

<p>Nobody seems to have noticed, but over the past couple months, this blog has been publishing a record post a day. Every weekday &#8212; plus, starting a little later, a bonus post on sundays &#8212; I&#8217;ve written an entirely new essay. I&#8217;ve done this while traveling, while celebrating holidays, while galavanting around the world, while sleeping on the couches of published authors. I&#8217;ve even written and posted whole pieces using the SSH feature on my cell phone.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know anyone else who has done this. There are columnists who write for the paper, but they only have to post a couple times a week. And there are bloggers who post many times a day, but they mostly post links and commentary, not whole essays. As far as I know, I&#8217;m alone in this bizarre pursuit.</p>

<p>It was a fun experiment but it was also a lot of work. I still have lots to say, but I&#8217;m not sure that forcing myself to say it every day is quite so healthy. I want to work on writing better, not just faster. I wrote most of the blog posts in about an hour and while they&#8217;re decent for something written at that rate, they can rarely be called great.</p>

<p>So I think it&#8217;s time to slow down, work more on crafting my prose, maybe write for magazines and other outlets. (If someone out there wants to publish me, <a href="mailto:me@aaronsw.com">drop me a line</a>!) This will probably hurt my readership, but running this blog has always been a weird and random occupation, done more for me than for page views.</p>

<p>So I guess that&#8217;s goodbye for now and thanks for stopping by. If this piece gets posted when it&#8217;s supposed to, it&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Day and I&#8217;ve still got a couple more weeks of winter break to spend world-travelling. So expect some silence until I get back. <em>Au revoir!</em></p>

<p>Could have been named &#8216;Jerry Roll&#8217; or something[This blog].</p>

<p>If you wanted to experiment with some &#8216;raw&#8217; thought thing with people - that could have been done too. But you seemignly chose to stick with very classic (and say muscline?) way of &#8216;deciding&#8217; what&#8217;s &#8216;writing&#8217; is.</p>

<p>So that kind of comes across. You are talking of some quite defenseless or exposing stuff - well that&#8217;s not bad thing, esp if you haven&#8217;t go through &#8216;school days&#8217; with many or even some close, reliable friends, talking over one subject  over years. But it&#8217;s written down, and with Times font face - and your tone is rather sober or classroom debating match.</p>

<p>Jerry won&#8217;t fit in the envelop. Jerry has to be shared casually and so on. We all could have been defenseless, exposing but trying to be creative and free. Not stuck in &#8216;straight jacket mode&#8217;.</p>

<p>But that kinda thing - may take a while to show up on the net.</p>

<p>Thanks to the beauty of RSS, there&#8217;s no reason to lose readership just because you&#8217;re no longer the Daily ASW.</p>

<p>Feeding the beast is exhausting, and one of the major problems with the blogging medium is that no one reads the archives.</p>
