<div class="content">
<p>Louis Menand on the Dr. Suess&#8217;s <cite>Cat in the Hat</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>[T]his is a story about a woman who leaves two very young children alone at home all day with the front door unlocked, under the supervision of a fish. [&#8230;]</p>
	
	<p>Where is the mom? That&#8217;s really the question that all readers want to know. What kind of dangerous mission is she on? Is it an erotic errand, possibly a murderous errand? We don&#8217;t know. But the thing is that she is clearly behaving in a transgressive way [&#8230;]</p>
	
	<p>[T]he cat is this polymorphous character who is of indeterminate sexuality, who unleashes these two&#8212;we have to call them personified genitalia. I mean, what are they named? Thing One and Thing Two. That&#8217;s a very ancient Anglo-Saxon colloquialism. And these libidinal creatures run around the house. They terrify the children, who kind of capture them with a net. And then the cat puts them back in a box, of course, and takes them out again. But he&#8217;s introducing them to their libidos, &#8216;cause they&#8217;re very uptight little persons, Sally and me.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8216;In this box are two things I will show to you now. You will like these two things,&#8217; said the cat with a bow. &#8216;These things will not bite you, they want to have fun.&#8217; Then out of the box came Thing 2 and Thing 1. And they ran to us fast. They said, &#8216;How do you do? Would you like to shake hands with Thing 1 and Thing 2?&#8217; And Sally and I did not know what to do, so we had to shake hands with Thing 1 and Thing 2. We shook their two hands, but our fish said, &#8216;No, no. Those things should not be in this house. Make them go. They should not be here when your mother is not. Put them out, put them out,&#8217; said the fish in the pot.</p>

<p>And while we&#8217;re quoting Louis Menand&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Katharine White once wrote to Norman Mailer asking if he would care to contribute a story to the magazine. He would not, Mailer replied, because he did not have the freedom to say &#8220;shit&#8221; in the <em>New Yorker</em>. White wrote back to suggest that perhaps Mr. Mailer did not understand the true meaning of freedom. Mailer answered that he did indeed understand the meaning of freedom: freedom meant being able to say &#8220;shit&#8221; in the <em>New Yorker</em>. n3</p>

<p>&#8220;Just because you can, doesn&#8217;t mean you should.&#8221; The obvious corollary being that simply because one has the right to do (or not do) something, does not necessarily make it a good idea. (And regarding your piece that almost ran in the New York Times, just because the mob of &#8220;democracy&#8221; want to do something doesn&#8217;t mean they have the right to do it. &#8220;If a million people do a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Could Louis Menand be anymore up tight is the real question here folks. Its a childrens story for (un-&#8220;P.C.&#8221; word) sake. I&#8217;ve read numerous stories where the author gives an animal human attributes. I believe that in Dr. Suess&#8217; world a fish is perfectly capable of babysitting a couple of kids. Get a better hobby buddy.</p>
