<div class="content">
<p><a href="http://blanu.net/curious_yellow.html">Curious Yellow</a>. There, I said it. I&#8217;ve been struggling over whether or not to say that for a while now. CY s the story of the superworm. The Really Big One. Full plans on how to take over the Internet in a matter of minutes, not get caught, and use it for whatever you like.</p>

<p>At a technical level, it&#8217;s a fascinating application of decentralized networks. At an emotional level, it&#8217;s a thrilling battle between two superpowers (along the lines of that in <cite>True Names</cite>, but far more likely). At a practical level, if it actually happened it could be a really big mess. And at a writing level, it&#8217;s a fun and humorous story to read. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s got lines like &#8220;Naturally, once an anti-virus patch for the worm becomes publicly available on the Internet, Curious Yellow will cause that site to disappear from the Internet.&#8221; and &#8220;[The anonymous network created by CY] would be a boon to the usual cast of characters that could benefit from anonymous communication, such as people attempting to escape human-rights-violating regimes, international terrorists, and music fans.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://blanu.net/curious_yellow.html">So go read it now</a> and find out how you can take over the whole Internet. And if you&#8217;re going to, could you give me 24 hours notice? Thanks.</p>
