	<h1>The World Is Watching</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p><em>The World is Watching</em> is an incredible and, to my knowledge, unique
film about the making of news. Two film crews, one at ABC News
headquarters in New York, the other with ABC&#8217;s Central American Unit
in Nicaragua, spend a day watching exactly how the clips that appear
on the national nightly news are made. The result is revealing.</p>

<p>The crew begins the day by checking in with Washington to get the
appropriate framing for the story. At the same time, they keep an ear
out for tips and scoops. They hear about a village leveled by the
contras (the US-funded group fighting Nicaragua&#8217;s socialist
government) and set out to get some film.</p>

<p>They interview a peasant. &#8220;You have to be angry,&#8221; the reporter coaches
his subject, who stubbornly remains calm and peaceful despite having
been brutally attacked. This peasant, like every other one in the
film, can clearly and eloquently explain exactly what&#8217;s going on:
Reagan is fighting a war by proxy against their government because it
has dared to institute policies which favor the poor (that is, people
like them) over the wealthy elites. They live in horrid conditions,
they are brutally attacked by contra forces, they appear to be just
poor and stupid peasants &#8212; yet they know exactly what&#8217;s going on and
tell the cameras as much.</p>

<p>The cameras, of course, know better. For the journalists and the folks
at home, the events are seen through a different frame. Five Central
American countries have signed a peace agreement promising to
institute Democratic reforms in exchange for peace. Most of these
countries are US client-states where the governments we instituted
brutally terrorize civilians and suppress democratic freedoms. The
media doesn&#8217;t see that, though. Instead, Reagan literally directs
their eyes elsewhere by delivering a heartfelt message to the media:
they have an import responsibility &#8212; perhaps &#8220;one of journalism&#8217;s
great triumphs,&#8221; he says &#8212; to ensure democracy flourishes&#8230; in
Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The journalists unquestionably accept this frame, sending camera crews
to Nicaragua, not the other countries. Once there they ensure
everything that comes back is fit into this frame. We watch as Peter
Jennings marvels at how the Sandanista government has managed to
survive the democratic reforms. We watch as the Washington team
carefully scrutinizes the voiceovers, blanching at the suggestion that
the protesters in the street are somehow &#8220;anti-war&#8221;. &#8220;It sounds like
they&#8217;re peaceniks or something,&#8221; one reporter says. Pro-Sandanista
protesters would be much better.</p>

<p>Once the piece hits air the peasant&#8217;s words, so eloquent before, are
chopped and translated for the larger audience. Now she is seen
stupidly insisting that she does not see communism. This is just a
backlash against being attacked by the contras, the voiceover
helpfully explains, and anyway, she&#8217;s just a peasant &#8212; what does she
know? Meanwhile, the Sandanista government still refuses to negotiate
with the contras and is thus presumably the cause of all this
violence. The whole piece takes up just two minutes on the news.</p>

<p>At the same time the piece airs on ABC, the facts on the ground show a
different story. Daniel Ortega, leader of the Sandanistas, is giving a
speech to a large assembled crowd. He <em>will</em> negotiate with the
Sandanistas, he says. It&#8217;s too late &#8212; the piece has been filed and
the ABC crew has already flown to the next day&#8217;s location. The folks
at home never hear the news.</p>
