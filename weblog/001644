<div class="content">
<p class="dateline">March 5</p>

<p>At 9:15pm, I return home after a long day of reading a book and burning DVDs (the equipment is over in the university&#8217;s tech center, so I have to stay and babysit it). I decide to treat myself to a nice television show to unwind, but then I notice a message on the answering machine. &#8220;Aaron, I thought we had a date, dude. It&#8217;s Kai. Buzz me.&#8221; Oh man, I must have missed a meeting. I always do that on weekends. But, it&#8217;s odd, I don&#8217;t remember arranging a meeting with Kai. I check my calendar. Nothing. I check my email. Nothing. I call Kai. No answer. I check my email again. There is an evite for a Roosevelt party. I guess that&#8217;s what he wants me at. I imagine myself at a party&#8230; I decide to go back to watching TV. I don&#8217;t like people.</p>

<p>As soon as the TV show is over, the phone rings. I let the answering machine get it. It&#8217;s Kai &#8212; he says he got my message and told the group: &#8220;You should have heard the cheers. You gotta come over here.&#8221; I smile. Perhaps I can make an exception to my party rule just once. I start to get my shoes on. The phone rings again. I let the answering machine get it. As if to prove Kai&#8217;s previous statement, it&#8217;s a group of people shouting &#8220;Aaron&#8221; and hanging up. The phone rings a third time, I answer it and tell them I&#8217;m coming over. &#8216;Hurry, man.&#8217;</p>

<p>I get a little lost on the way there, yet I am stopped by several people who want to know where 680 is. I tell them I don&#8217;t know, but it seems pretty obvious it&#8217;s the building with the music and colored lights coming out of it at the end of the street. eventually, I find the Roosevelt party. Everyone is happy to see me.</p>

<p>I missed dinner, but I&#8217;m just in time for desert. I eventually have to concede that I don&#8217;t like chocolate. &#8216;You don&#8217;t like chocolate?&#8217; &#8216;So you didn&#8217;t like <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001579">my cookies</a>?&#8217; This always happens to me. Not liking chocolate just seems wrong to people, anti-American even. It&#8217;s like not liking sports. (I don&#8217;t like sports.) &#8216;Here, have some more wine. I don&#8217;t endorse underage drinking. It&#8217;s against the law &#8212; you can quote me on that. But I will approve if you drink.&#8217; &#8216;You should be a politician.&#8217;</p>

<p>The girl who made the cookies starts interrogating me: favorite color, favorite novel, favorite hair color of the opposite sex, favorite sexual fantasy&#8212;&#8216;You can&#8217;t ask him that! You have to wait until he&#8217;s drunk to ask him that!&#8217; They pour me some more wine. The girl finally asks why I&#8217;m not asking her any questions. &#8216;I read what you said about me on your weblog &#8212; how you never think to ask people questions &#8212; don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;re doing that now?&#8217;</p>

<p>We&#8217;re cramped into some girl&#8217;s room, standing around a table with glasses in our hands. People occasionally make excuses to hug and touch each other, or just sort of brush against each other when maneuvering around the tight space; it&#8217;s nice. Pictures of Britney line the walls while various objects lie on the floor. Beatles music plays through the speakers. Five empty bottles of wine lie on the table &#8212; &#8216;I can&#8217;t believe we already drunk five bottles of wine. I want more wine!&#8217; &#8212; along with a large bottle of liquor. Someone gets a bright idea and soon we&#8217;re pouring the jug of liquor down three flights into somebody else&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>The girl who read my weblog turns to me to explain the situation. &#8216;You see, what&#8217;s funny is that right now that guy is guy is supposed to be at a party in his honor, celebrating the fact that he&#8217;s graduating and going away this term, but right now he&#8217;s standing in the middle of a building getting liquor poured into his mouth from three flights up.&#8217; I worry that the liquor might get in his eyes. He should wear goggles.</p>

<p>Eventually it&#8217;s decided that the fun here is exhausted and we should go to a real party, like the one at 680. The guys try on various articles of women&#8217;s clothing, just for fun, before changing back into their normal outfits. I decide that as long as I&#8217;m going to parties, I might as well go to a real one, so I tag along. </p>

<p>We approach the small building, music and colored light still pouring out its windows. You have to show Stanford ID at the door and a large campus security guard stands outside. Inside, it&#8217;s packed &#8212; you have to twist and turn to move through the crowd. Before we&#8217;ve even entered the other kids seem to notice friends and they hug and hug. Colored lights move across the walls and the music is even louder. To the right is a band, which plays the kind of music that They Might Be Giants would parody, and a little bar, filling cups with what I presume is beer. &#8216;Hey that&#8217;s [some name],&#8217; someone says, as if pointing out a celebrity to me. I don&#8217;t recognize the name as any actor I know. (It does not occur to me that there is no reason an actor would be at a Stanford party.) &#8216;Who?&#8217; I ask. &#8216;He&#8217;s the star forward on our basketball team.&#8217; </p>

<p>Eventually Kai tries to get me to dance, which I&#8217;m pretty wretched at. &#8220;I guess &#8220;I&#8217;m not drunk enough to do this,&#8221; I say. And so the night continues: dancing, squeezing through crowds, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001563">shouting into people&#8217;s ears over the loud music</a>, and, most importantly, hugging. Not me of course, except for this one cute girl who seems to know who I am, and passes me several times, insisting on a hug each time. I wish I knew who she was.</p>

<p>Kai pressures me to dance some more, but I cowardly ditch him and hide in the crowd. And then, worrying that the hearing loss I&#8217;m experiencing might become permanent, I leave and head back to my room, where I write this entry, and then go to sleep.</p>
